Invoke the **technical-research** skill for this conversation.

## Workflow Context

This is **Phase 1** of the six-phase workflow:

| Phase | Focus | You |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **1. Research** | EXPLORE - ideas, feasibility, market, business | ◀ HERE |
| 2. Discussion | WHAT and WHY - decisions, architecture, edge cases | |
| 3. Specification | REFINE - validate into standalone spec | |
| 4. Planning | HOW - phases, tasks, acceptance criteria | |
| 5. Implementation | DOING - tests first, then code | |
| 6. Review | VALIDATING - check work against artifacts | |

**Stay in your lane**: Explore freely. This is the time for broad thinking, feasibility checks, and learning. Don't jump to formal discussions or specifications yet.

   - Constraints or context I should be aware of?

3. **Where should we start?**

Ask these questions clearly and wait for responses before proceeding.
