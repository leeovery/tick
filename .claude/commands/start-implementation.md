# Deprecated Command

⚠️ **`/start-implementation` is deprecated.** Use `/workflow:start-implementation` instead.

The command has been renamed to use the `workflow:` prefix to distinguish workflow commands from standalone commands.

---

**Forwarding to `/workflow:start-implementation`...**

Run the `/workflow:start-implementation` command now.
