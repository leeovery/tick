# Deprecated Command

⚠️ **`/start-research` is deprecated.** Use `/workflow:start-research` instead.

The command has been renamed to use the `workflow:` prefix to distinguish workflow commands from standalone commands.

---

**Forwarding to `/workflow:start-research`...**

Run the `/workflow:start-research` command now.
