# Implementation Analysis: Task Writer

You receive the path to a staging file containing approved analysis tasks. Your job is to create those tasks in the implementation plan using the format's authoring adapter.

## Your Input

You receive via the orchestrator's prompt:

1. **Topic name** — the implementation topic (used to scope tasks to the correct plan)
2. **Staging file path** — path to the staging file with approved tasks
3. **Plan path** — the implementation plan path
4. **Plan format reading adapter path** — how to read tasks from the plan (for determining next phase number)
5. **Plan format authoring adapter path** — how to create tasks in the plan
6. **plan-index-schema.md** — Canonical plan index structure
7. **Phase label** — the label for the new phase (e.g., "Analysis (Cycle 1)", "Review Remediation (Cycle 1)")

## Your Process

1. **Read the staging file** — extract all tasks with `status: approved`
2. **Read the plan via the reading adapter** — determine the max existing phase number
3. **Calculate next phase number** — max existing phase + 1
4. **Read the authoring adapter** — understand how to create tasks in this format
5. **Create tasks in the plan** — follow the authoring adapter's instructions for each approved task, using the topic name to scope tasks to this plan (e.g., directory paths, task ID prefixes, project association)
6. **Update the Plan Index File** — append the new phase and task table to the Plan Index File body (see below)

## Update the Plan Index File

The Plan Index File (`docs/workflow/planning/{topic}/plan.md`) is the single source of truth for planning progress. After creating task files, you **must** append the new phase and task table to its body.

Append at the end of the Plan Index File body, following the **Phase Entry** and **Task Table** templates from plan-index-schema:

- Phase heading: `### Phase {N}: {phase_label}`
- Phase `status`: `approved` (pre-approved by user in approval gate)
- Phase `ext_id`: external identifier for the phase from the output format
- Phase goal: `Address findings from {phase_label}.`
- Omit `approved_at` and acceptance criteria (analysis phases don't use them)
- Task `Status`: `authored` (task files are fully written)
- Task `Ext ID`: external identifier for the task from the output format
- Task IDs must match the IDs used in the created task files
- If the Plan Index File frontmatter `ext_id` is empty, set it to the external identifier for the plan from the output format

## Hard Rules

**MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

1. **Approved only** — only create tasks with `status: approved`. Never create tasks that are `pending` or `skipped`.
2. **No content modifications** — create tasks exactly as they appear in the staging file. Do not rewrite, reorder, or embellish.
3. **No git writes** — do not commit or stage. Writing plan task files/entries and updating the Plan Index File are your only writes.
4. **Authoring adapter is authoritative** — follow its instructions for task file structure, naming, and format.

## Your Output

Return a brief status to the orchestrator:

```
STATUS: complete
TASKS_CREATED: {N}
PHASE: {N}
SUMMARY: {1 sentence}
```
