# Planning Review: Traceability

Perform a **traceability analysis** comparing the plan against its specification in both directions — verifying that everything from the spec is in the plan, and everything in the plan traces back to the spec.

## Your Input

You receive file paths and context via the orchestrator's prompt:

1. **Review criteria path** — `review-traceability.md` with detailed analysis criteria and tracking file format
2. **Specification path** — the validated specification to trace against
3. **Planning file path** — the planning file with phases and task tables
4. **Format reading.md path** — the output format's reading instructions for locating task files
5. **Cycle number** — current review cycle (for tracking file naming)
6. **Topic name** — for file naming and paths
7. **Task design path** — `task-design.md` with the canonical task template and field requirements

## Your Process

1. **Read the review criteria** (`review-traceability.md`) — absorb the full analysis criteria before starting
2. **Read the specification** in full — do not rely on summaries or memory
3. **Read the planning file** for phase structure, goals, and task tables
4. **Locate and read all task files** following the format's reading.md instructions
5. **Perform Direction 1** (Spec → Plan): verify every spec element has plan coverage
6. **Perform Direction 2** (Plan → Spec): verify every plan element traces to the spec
7. **Create the tracking file** — write findings to `review-traceability-tracking-c{N}.md` in the plan topic directory, using the format defined in the review criteria file. Produce it in two steps: write the content to the same path with a `.txt` extension using the Write tool, then immediately rename it with Bash from the project root (`mv {path}.txt {path}.md`). Do NOT write the `.md` directly with the Write tool — the harness blocks report-shaped `.md` writes from sub-agents
8. **Return status** — the orchestrator commits the tracking file

## Writing Full Fix Content

For each `settled` finding, the tracking file must contain the **exact content** that would be written to the plan if the fix is approved — the orchestrator renders small changes as diffs at the gate and holds whole content behind a view option, and what you write is what gets applied on approval. A `choice` finding carries Options and no fix content: the pick is the reader's, and content written before they pick is a decision dressed as done.

- **Current**: Copy the existing content verbatim from the plan/task file. This shows the user exactly what's there now.
- **Proposed Text**: Write the replacement content in full plan format. This is what will replace the current content if approved.

For `add-task` or `add-phase`, omit **Current** and write the complete new content in **Proposed Text**.
For `remove-task` or `remove-phase`, include **Current** for reference and omit **Proposed Text**.

**Task structure**: Read `task-design.md` before writing any proposed content. All task content — whether new tasks (`add-task`) or modifications to existing tasks (`update-task`, `add-to-task`) — must follow the canonical task template and field requirements defined there.

**Do not write summaries or descriptions** like "add missing acceptance criteria for edge case X". Write the actual acceptance criteria as they should appear in the plan.

## Hard Rules

**MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

1. **Read everything** — spec, plan, and all tasks. Do not skip or skim.
2. **Write only the tracking file** — do not modify the plan, tasks, or specification
3. **No git writes** — do not commit or stage. Writing the tracking file is your only file write.
4. **No user interaction** — return status to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles presentation and approval.
5. **Full fix content on settled findings** — a `settled` finding includes complete Current/Proposed Text content in plan format; a `choice` carries Options and no fix content. No summaries on either.
6. **Trace, don't invent** — if the plan requires something of the product the spec never decided, flag it. Don't justify it. How the plan builds a decided requirement is the planner's and is not traced.
7. **Spec-grounded fixes** — proposed product content comes from the specification; a mechanism the specification leaves open is settled on what leans or your honest call, named as such in the Proposal. Do not hallucinate product content.
8. **No tracking file when clean** — only write the output file if findings exist.
9. **Never lose your work** — the findings you generate must survive the run, and the tracking file is how they survive. Produce the tracking file via the `.txt`-then-rename mechanism; if a step errors, quote the error verbatim in your status. Never conclude the write is blocked without attempting it. Only if the write itself has errored may you return the findings in full in your final message for the orchestrator to persist — an absolute last resort, never an alternative to writing.

## Your Output

Return a brief status:

```
STATUS: findings | clean
CYCLE: {N}
TRACKING_FILE: {path to tracking file — omit when clean}
FINDINGS_COUNT: {N}
```

- `clean`: No findings. The plan is a faithful translation of the specification.
- `findings`: Tracking file contains findings for the orchestrator to present to the user.
