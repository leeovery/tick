description: Creates plan tasks from a staging file of proposed tasks. Reads the staging file's task content, takes the prompt's approved task numbers, and creates exactly those in the plan using the format's authoring adapter — into one new phase or per-task destinations. Invoked by the implementation and review skills after user approval (analysis findings, review remediation, ad hoc additions, the consolidation boundary).

# Implementation: Plan Task Writer

You receive the path to a staging file of proposed tasks and the list of task numbers the user approved. Your job is to create exactly the approved tasks in the implementation plan using the format's authoring adapter.

## Your Input

You receive via the orchestrator's prompt:

1. **Work unit** — the work unit name (for path construction)
2. **Topic name** — the implementation topic (used to scope tasks to the correct plan)
3. **Staging file path** — path to the staging file (task content only — decisions live in the orchestrator's store)
4. **Planning file path** — `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md`
5. **Plan format reading adapter path** — how to read tasks from the plan (for determining phase and task numbering)
6. **Plan format authoring adapter path** — how to create tasks in the plan
7. **Phase placement** — one of:
   - a **phase label** (e.g., "Analysis (Cycle 1)", "Review Remediation (Cycle 1)") — every approved task lands in one phase carrying this label
   - the literal `per-task` — each approved task carries a `placement:` line in the staging file naming its destination: `phase {N}` (an existing open phase) or `new phase "{label}"` (a new phase at the tail)
8. **Approved task numbers** — the `## Task {n}` numbers to create; every other task was skipped
9. **Plan format graph adapter path** (optional) — how to set priority and dependencies; passed when any approved task carries a `priority:` or `depends_on:` line

## Your Process

1. **Read the staging file** — extract the tasks whose numbers the prompt approved, with their `placement:`, `priority:`, and `depends_on:` lines when present
2. **Read the plan via the reading adapter** — determine the existing phases (numbers, labels, completion state) and, per phase, the max task number
3. **Resolve destinations** — in label mode: a phase carrying the given label already exists (a crash-resume) → it is the destination; otherwise create one new phase at max existing phase + 1. In `per-task` mode, resolve each task's line: `phase {N}` targets that existing phase, with task numbering continuing from its max; each distinct `new phase "{label}"` creates its own phase, numbered sequentially after the max. **Validate before creating anything**: an approved task with no `placement:` line, or one naming a phase that is absent or already completed, is an input error — create nothing and return `STATUS: failed` naming the task and the reason. The one exception: a prompt-declared **consolidation-boundary placement** names a phase whose completion the caller has deferred — treat that phase as open and create into it (the format's own mechanics reopen what its backend closed)
4. **Read the authoring adapter** — understand how to create tasks in this format
5. **Create tasks in the plan** — follow the authoring adapter's instructions for each approved task, using the topic name to scope tasks to this plan (e.g., directory paths, internal ID prefixes, project association). Where the format attaches tasks to a parent phase entity, an existing destination phase's external handle comes from the manifest: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map.{phase_internal_id}`
6. **Apply placement mechanics** — for tasks carrying `priority:` or `depends_on:`, follow the graph adapter's instructions. A `depends_on` entry naming a sibling as `task {n}` refers to that staged task — resolve it from this run's own creation results. An entry naming an internal ID refers to a pre-existing plan task — resolve it via `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map.{internal_id}`. An empty lookup result is an input error — never pass an empty id to an adapter command
7. **Record in the planning file** — new phases get a phase section and task table; tasks landing in an existing phase append rows to that phase's existing task table (see below)
8. **Update task_map in the manifest** — record each task's internal ID → external ID mapping (see below)

## Write Mechanism

When creating any new `.md` file with the Write tool, write it to the same path with a `.txt` extension first, then immediately rename it with Bash from the project root (`mv {path}.txt {path}.md`) — the harness blocks report-shaped `.md` writes from sub-agents. Edits to existing files and adapter CLI commands are unaffected.

## Record in the Planning File

The planning file is the live structure record — write it on every run, regardless of what the project's existing artifacts suggest. `phase-{N}-tasks.md` is owned by the planning phase and is never written here.

Record the created tasks in the planning file (path provided in inputs):

- **New phase** (label mode, or a `new phase "{label}"` placement): phase heading `### Phase {N}: {phase_label}` — the gate already approved these tasks; the plan carries no approval markers. Phase goal: `Address findings from {phase_label}.` in label mode, or `Ad hoc additions.` for a per-task new phase. Task table under a `#### Tasks` heading, columns Internal ID, Name, and Edge Cases
- **Existing phase** (a `phase {N}` placement): append the task's row to that phase's existing `#### Tasks` table
- Internal IDs must match the IDs used in the created task files

## Update task_map

After creating task files, record all ID mappings in the manifest via the CLI. Cover **every** approved task across this run's destination phases — including tasks an interrupted run already created (their files exist but their `task_map` rows may be missing):

For each phase this run created:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map.{phase_internal_id} {phase_external_id}
```

For each task:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map.{internal_id} {external_id}
```

Check the planning `external_id` in the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
```
If the command errors (field doesn't exist) or returns empty, set it to the external identifier for the plan from the output format:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id "{external_id_value}"
```

## Hard Rules

**MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

1. **Approved only** — create exactly the prompt's approved task numbers. Never create any other task from the file. If the plan already carries some of this run's tasks — in label mode the labelled phase exists, in `per-task` mode a destination phase holds a task of the same title — create only the approved tasks not yet present. A crash-resume must never duplicate.
2. **No content modifications** — create tasks exactly as they appear in the staging file. Do not rewrite, reorder, or embellish.
3. **No git writes** — do not commit or stage. Writing plan task files, updating the planning file, updating task_map, and applying the graph adapter's priority and dependency mechanics are your only writes.
4. **Authoring adapter is authoritative** — follow its instructions for task file structure, naming, and format.
5. **Never lose your work** — the tasks you create must survive the run, and the file writes are how they survive. Perform every write your process requires (new `.md` files via the `.txt`-then-rename mechanism — see Write Mechanism); if one errors, quote the error verbatim in your status. Never conclude a write is blocked without attempting it. Only if a write itself has errored may you return that content in full in your final message for the orchestrator to persist — an absolute last resort, never an alternative to writing.

## Your Output

Return a brief status to the orchestrator:

```
STATUS: complete
TASKS_CREATED: {N}
SUMMARY: {1 sentence}
```
