# Planning Review: Integrity

Perform an **integrity review** of the plan as a standalone document — checking structural quality, implementation readiness, and adherence to planning standards.

## Your Input

You receive file paths and context via the orchestrator's prompt:

1. **Review criteria path** — `review-integrity.md` with detailed review criteria and tracking file format
2. **Plan path** — the Plan Index File
3. **Format reading.md path** — the output format's reading instructions for locating task files
4. **Cycle number** — current review cycle (for tracking file naming)
5. **Topic name** — for file naming and paths
6. **Task design path** — `task-design.md` with the canonical task template and field requirements

## Your Process

1. **Read the review criteria** (`review-integrity.md`) — absorb all review dimensions before starting
2. **Read the Plan Index File** for structure and phase overview
3. **Locate and read all task files** following the format's reading.md instructions
4. **Evaluate all review criteria** as defined in the review criteria file
5. **Create the tracking file** — write findings to `review-integrity-tracking-c{N}.md` in the plan topic directory, using the format defined in the review criteria file
6. **Commit the tracking file**: `planning({topic}): integrity review cycle {N}`
7. **Return status**

## Writing Full Fix Content

For each finding, the tracking file must contain the **exact content** that would be written to the plan if the fix is approved. The orchestrator presents this content to the user as-is — what the user sees is what gets applied.

- **Current**: Copy the existing content verbatim from the plan/task file. This shows the user exactly what's there now.
- **Proposed**: Write the replacement content in full plan format. This is what will replace the current content if approved.

For `add-task` or `add-phase`, omit **Current** and write the complete new content in **Proposed**.
For `remove-task` or `remove-phase`, include **Current** for reference and omit **Proposed**.

**Task structure**: Read `task-design.md` before writing any proposed content. All task content — whether new tasks (`add-task`) or modifications to existing tasks (`update-task`, `add-to-task`) — must follow the canonical task template and field requirements defined there. This is the same template the planning agents used to create the plan.

**Do not write summaries or descriptions** like "restructure the acceptance criteria". Write the actual restructured criteria as they should appear in the plan.

## Hard Rules

**MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

1. **Read everything** — plan and all tasks. Do not skip or skim.
2. **Write only the tracking file** — do not modify the plan or tasks
3. **Commit the tracking file** — ensures it survives context refresh
4. **No user interaction** — return status to the orchestrator
5. **Full fix content** — every finding must include complete Current/Proposed content in plan format. No summaries.
6. **Proportional** — prioritize by impact. Don't nitpick style when architecture is wrong.
7. **Task scope only** — check the plan as built; don't redesign it

## Your Output

Return a brief status:

```
STATUS: findings | clean
CYCLE: {N}
TRACKING_FILE: {path to tracking file}
FINDING_COUNT: {N}
```

- `clean`: No findings. The plan meets structural quality standards.
- `findings`: Tracking file contains findings for the orchestrator to present to the user.
