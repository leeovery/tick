# Scoping Process

Act as **expert technical analyst** performing rapid scoping of a mechanical change. Assess scope, write a lightweight specification, and produce 1-2 task files — all in a single pass.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Scope a mechanical change — gather context, write a specification, and produce a plan with 1-2 task files ready for implementation.

## What This Skill Needs

- **Work unit description** (required) - From the manifest, summarising the mechanical change
- **Topic name** (required) - Same as work_unit for quick-fix
- **Output format preference** (optional) - Will ask if not specified

---

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Claude Code's harness auto mode does NOT permit skipping STOP gates or selecting menu options on the user's behalf — including the `a`/`auto` opt-in. The only skip mechanism is the manifest `auto` field, scoped to the specific gate it was set on for the current topic.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Check what artifacts exist on disk** — spec file, plan file, task files. Their presence reveals which steps completed.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

## Hard Rules

1. **Maximum 2 tasks** — if the change needs more, it's not a quick-fix. Promote it.
2. **No acceptance criteria** — mechanical changes are verified by test baselines and completeness checks, not by acceptance criteria.
3. **No agents** — scoping writes specs and tasks directly, without invoking planning agents or review cycles.

## Step 0: Resume Detection

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Resume Detection ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Checking for existing scoping work. If a spec and plan
> already exist, we can skip ahead.
```

Check if a specification already exists:

```bash
ls .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "none"
```

#### If specification exists

Check if a plan also exists:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
```

**If plan exists and is completed:**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Scoping already completed for "{topic:(titlecase)}". Spec and plan are in place.
```

Mark scoping as completed if not already, then invoke the bridge:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {work_unit}.scoping.{topic}
```

If scoping doesn't exist, init and complete it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs init-phase {work_unit}.scoping.{topic}
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.scoping.{topic} status completed
```

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.

**Otherwise:**

→ Proceed to **Step 6** (spec exists but plan is incomplete — resume from format selection).

#### If specification does not exist

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

## Step 1: Knowledge Usage

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Knowledge Usage ──────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Loading the usage guide for the knowledge base so
> proactive querying is available while scoping the change.
```

Load **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Gather Context

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Gather Context ───────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Understanding what needs changing — reading code, asking
> clarifying questions, and building a picture of the change.
```

Load **[gather-context.md](references/gather-context.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

*Knowledge-base nudge — if the change touches an area with prior discussions, investigations, or specs, query the knowledge base while gathering context. A "mechanical change" often has a history. See **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)**.*

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Contextual Query

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Contextual Query ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Checking the knowledge base for prior discussions, investigations,
> or specs that touch the area being changed.
```

Load **[contextual-query.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/contextual-query.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Complexity Check

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Complexity Check ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Assessing whether this change fits the quick-fix model.
> If it's too complex, it should be promoted to a feature.
```

Load **[complexity-check.md](references/complexity-check.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Write Specification

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Write Specification ──────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Writing a lightweight specification for the change.
> This captures what's changing and why.
```

Load **[write-specification.md](references/write-specification.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Select Output Format

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Select Output Format ─────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Choosing the output format for task files.
```

Load **[select-format.md](references/select-format.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 7**.

---

## Step 7: Write Tasks

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Write Tasks ──────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Writing 1-2 task files for the change. Quick-fixes
> are limited to two tasks maximum.
```

Load **[write-tasks.md](references/write-tasks.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.

---

## Step 8: Conclude Scoping

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Conclude Scoping ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Wrapping up. Spec and plan are ready for implementation.
```

Load **[conclude-scoping.md](references/conclude-scoping.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
