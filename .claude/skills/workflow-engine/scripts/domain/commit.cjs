//   names, built in a scratch index (`commitUntrack`). A peer session's dirty
//   or staged files are never swept up under someone else's message, and no
//   engine commit reaches outside its declared scope.
//
// - Commits are serialised: a process-wide lock (`.git/workflows-commit.lock`,
//   same discipline as the manifest lock, on a longer clock) holds each
//   add+commit sequence alone, so concurrent sessions never interleave on
//   git's shared index.
