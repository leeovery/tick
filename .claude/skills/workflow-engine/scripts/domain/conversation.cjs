// Domain ring: the conversation's folder — what belongs to one Claude Code
// conversation rather than to a work unit. A conversation visits several
// work units, or none (the start menu, the roadmap), so its records cannot
// live in a unit's cache, which goes when the unit closes; nor in the
// project, since the directory a conversation runs in moves under it — a
// `cd` Claude runs moves it, and a conversation can be resumed from another
// directory. Each conversation that runs the workflows has one folder beside
// the system config, `{config}/conversations/{session-id}/`, found by the
// session id Claude Code hands every command it runs, wherever the command
// runs, and each concern writes a file of its own there, so no two writers
// ever share one:
//
//   workflow       the mark that the conversation runs the workflows, which
//                  the gate mod reads to set the workflow harness — written
//                  by every engine and gateway call that carries a session
//                  id, run in a project whose `.workflows/` already exists
//   transcript     the conversation's transcript path, written as it ends by
//                  the SessionEnd hook
//   position.json  the tmux label's resume position (session-label.cjs)
//   gate.json      the gate the mod keeps for a resume (the mod's own)
//   sent.json      what the mod last sent from a press (the mod's own)
//   rows.json      each answer row the rows mod redrew, by message id (its own)
//
// A folder goes at any project's boot once its transcript is gone: Claude
// Code has deleted the conversation, so nothing can resume it, and whatever
// retention the person set is the retention these records keep. The recorded
// path does not say where the transcript is — a resume from another
// directory hands the hook a path under that directory's project key while
// Claude Code goes on writing where the conversation began — so the path is
// read only for the directory Claude Code keeps its projects in, and the
// transcript is looked for by its file name in every project folder there. A
// folder whose conversation ended without the hook names no transcript and
// stays, as does one naming a relative path (a leading `~` is the home
// directory) or a projects directory that cannot be read.
