// Domain ring: the boot pipeline — the sequential entry checks Step 0 needs,
// collapsed into one call: run migrations, probe the knowledge base, and when
// it is ready run the bulk index — the store brought in line with the
// files — then compact it.
//
// Migrations are the durability-critical leg: a failing migrate.cjs is a hard
// error — migrations must never half-run silently. A run that recorded
// migrations without changing a document leaves the tracking ledger as the
// only dirt, and no reviewed commit follows a report of no changes, so boot
// commits that line itself — this run's, or one an earlier boot stranded.
//
// The knowledge directory — the store, its metadata, the knowledge config —
// is local to each checkout and never in git: boot keeps git from tracking
// anything under it, and keeps its files listed in `.worktreeinclude` so a
// worktree Claude Code creates starts with a copy. A checkout set up (its
// local config) with no store gets one built by the bulk index when this
// machine's config says how — `check` answers `buildable`. Anything else
// not-ready is the caller's gate: boot never sets a checkout up itself, and
// a not-ready response carries the system-config report so the gate can
// offer setup without extra probes. A failing bulk index or compact is a
// warning, never a block.
//
// Boot is also where the conversation folders are tidied, whichever project
// the conversations ran in: one goes once its transcript is gone.
