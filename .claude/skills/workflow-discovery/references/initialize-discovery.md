# Initialize Discovery

*Reference for **[workflow-discovery](../SKILL.md)***

---

1. Ensure the session-log and briefs directories exist: `mkdir -p .workflows/{work_unit}/discovery/sessions/ .workflows/{work_unit}/discovery/briefs/` (safe to re-run).
2. Hold the following in conversation memory — the lazy session-log write records them in the log's header sections ([template.md](template.md) → *Description*, *Seeds*, *Imports*), and the session loop's opener and seed/import-launchpad branch read them:
   - `session_number` — set before this step (Step 6 on resume, Step 7 for a fresh session, the confirm-trigger for a new epic, or the roadmap pull for a pull-born one).
   - `description` — from the most recent discovery output.
   - `seeds` — from the most recent discovery output (may be empty — treat as "none"). The work unit's origin when it was promoted from the inbox.
   - `imports` — from the most recent discovery output (may be empty — treat as "none").
   - `map_state_at_start` — `map_summary` from the most recent discovery output. Write `(empty — first session)` when the map is empty.

**Do not create the session log file here.** For a new epic `session-001.md` is already on disk — written by the confirm-trigger, or by the roadmap pull's backfill; otherwise the file is conjured lazily on the first state change — see [template.md](template.md) → *Lazy creation and finalisation*.

No commit at this step.
