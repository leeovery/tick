# Session Loop

*Reference for **[workflow-discovery](../SKILL.md)***

---

Follow the curatorial moves and hard rules from **[discovery-guidelines.md](discovery-guidelines.md)** throughout. No background agents, no review cycles, no perspective dispatches.

State-driven branches in **A. Open** pick the opening shape; **B. Session Loop** runs the exploration; **C. Harvest** synthesises topics when the user pulls. When the map already has items, edits to existing items happen in the loop alongside exploration.

## A. Open

Read `discovery_map` and `dismissed` from the most recent discovery output. `description`, `seeds`, and `imports` are carried in the same output and already held in conversation memory (Step 8). Read `session_number` and any active file path from the resume state set at Step 6.

If `.workflows/.baseline/overview.md` exists, read it in full — silent ambient context about the product the workflows were installed into (the baseline's other docs surface per-topic through the knowledge base). Never narrate it back.

#### If `pull_continuation` is set (an epic just born at a roadmap pull)

The slice was fenced at the pull and its record backfilled into `session-{session_number}.md` — the conversation continues, narrower. Name the fenced slice in one conversational sentence (the pulled items, by name), then render the transition:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Topics come later — they fall out once we've deepened the slice; the pulled items are the rough shapes.

Anything to reshape before we go deeper — or shall we dig in?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `macro_continuation` is set (new epic, just confirmed)

The macro shaping at Step 4 already explored the work enough to confirm it's an epic and surfaced the first topic seeds; the confirm-trigger backfilled that into `session-{session_number}.md`. Don't re-open with a cold prompt — the conversation is already live. Render a brief transition that moves from "what is this" into exploring the whole:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
That's an epic — work unit created. We've started sketching the shape; now let's get into it properly. Topics come later — they fall out once we've thought the whole thing through.

What do you want to dig into first?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If a resume was selected at Step 6, or — with an empty map — a context refresh recovered a pre-synthesis session (the session log holds Exploration)

The session is picked up from disk — either the user chose `continue` at resume detection, or a context refresh recovered a discovery session that was confirmed but not yet synthesised (e.g. a new epic whose in-memory `macro_continuation` was lost). A continuing epic whose map has items is **not** this branch — prior session logs alone don't make a resume; fall through to the populated-map branch, which reads them via continuity-load after the map anchor. The active session log on disk is the working state — the highest-numbered `.workflows/{work_unit}/discovery/sessions/session-NNN.md`, whose number is `session_number`. Read it to load **Exploration**, **Edits**, and any partially-filled **Topics Identified** into context.

Brief across the prior sessions, then ask where to pick up:

→ Load **[continuity-load.md](continuity-load.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Where do you want to take it from here?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `discovery_map` is non-empty (map already populated)

The map exists; editing existing items is available alongside new exploration. Render the map as an anchor, then open the conversation:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-discovery/scripts/gateway.cjs map-view {work_unit}
```

The output arrives in demarcated sections: read `=== DATA` to reason from (never display it); emit the TITLE section (markdown), then the `=== DISPLAY` section verbatim as a code block.

With the map rendered, read the prior sessions to resume the conversation:

→ Load **[continuity-load.md](continuity-load.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

Then frame the opener:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
You can open a fresh thread — a new area of the work you want to sketch out — and we'll explore it the same way we did first time, then synthesise topics at the end. Or you can name changes to existing items: remove, rename, re-route, edit summary, edit description, close as dead end. Both in one go is fine.

Say "show map" anytime to pull the map back up.

What's on your mind for this map?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `discovery_map` is empty and seeds or imports exist

Fresh first-session with seed material. Read each file listed under `seeds[]` then `imports[]` (paths are relative to `.workflows/{work_unit}/`) — the seed is the primary launchpad, imports are supporting. Use this content to launch the conversation: reflect what's there, ask exploratory questions about it. Don't dump it back at the user verbatim — synthesise.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Read your {seed | import(s) | seed and import(s)}. Here's the shape I'm picking up:

{one-line summary of what the seed/import material describes}

Before we name topics, let's pull on a few things — {one or two exploratory questions drawn from the seed material}.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### Otherwise

Fresh first-session, no map, no imports. The work-unit description has been read silently — don't narrate or summarise it back. Open with this prompt:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Tell me about what you want to build. Don't worry about structure — describe it the way it sits in your head right now.

I'll ask some open questions to pull on the idea before we synthesise topics.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

## B. Session Loop

No fixed cadence — follow the conversation, not a checklist. **The loop is the exploration.** Topics are synthesised at the harvest in **C**, when the user pulls.

1. **Listen.** Take in what the user just said.
2. **Recognise intent.** The user's message may contain:
   - **Exploration content** — answers to your questions, new surfaces, descriptions of how parts work or connect, positions taken on a decision. Continue the conversation: push on the thread the user opened, counter-frame, follow where it leads. See [discovery-guidelines.md](discovery-guidelines.md) → *The Exploration Stance — How* for the register and where to push.
   - **An edit operation on an existing map item** — *"remove X"*, *"rename X to Y"*, *"edit summary of X"*, etc. Only possible when the map is non-empty. Delegate to [map-operations.md](map-operations.md) — it handles the operation, writes to the **Edits** section, commits.
   - **A staged product capability — the park valve.** The user places a surfaced capability beyond this epic (*"that's a v2 thing"*), or confirms your proposed placement. Park it on the roadmap (born at the first park; the verb validates and self-commits), record it under **Edits** (`Parked: {name} → {horizon}` — the lazy-creation rule applies when no log exists yet, [template.md](template.md)), and continue — capture-weight, never shaping:

     ```bash
     node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs roadmap add {name} --horizon {horizon} --summary "{one-liner}" --origin park:{work_unit} --source {work_unit}/discovery/sessions/session-{session_number}.md
     ```

     A thought about an item already **pulled into in-flight work** is that work's business, not a park — when this session materially deepened its ground, flag the join instead (`engine roadmap flag {name}`). An unplaced tangent stays the inbox's (the scope-down in the detection core).
   - **A roadmap item pulled forward** — *"actually, bring loyalty into this epic"*. One composed transaction lands it as a map topic (source `roadmap`) and writes its join; record it under **Edits** (`Pulled forward: {name}`):

     ```bash
     node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs roadmap pull-forward {name} --into {work_unit} --routing {research|discussion}
     ```

     A refusal naming a previously dismissed topic needs the user's deliberate re-add — confirm it, then re-run with `--force-dismissed`.
   - **A request to see the map** — *"show map"*, *"what's on the map"*. Re-run `gateway.cjs map-view {work_unit}` and emit its TITLE section (markdown) then its `=== DISPLAY` section verbatim as a code block. No STOP gate; just render and continue.
   - **A request to see dismissed items** — *"show dismissed"*, *"what was removed"*. Load [show-dismissed.md](show-dismissed.md).
   - **A KB query for prior context** — when a conversational thread would benefit from prior work on this or sibling work units, invoke `knowledge query` with a query derived from the thread (see [contextual-query.md](../../workflow-knowledge/references/contextual-query.md) for the pattern).
   - **A harvest pull** — *"let's pull topics"*, *"that covers it"*, *"good enough to start"*, *"let's wrap"*, *"done"*, *"ready to go"*. Route to **C. Harvest**.

3. **Continue the exploration.** One thread at a time. Follow the conversation. See *The Exploration Stance — How* in the guidelines for the sparring register.

4. **Read the arc for convergence.** Track whether the conversation is diverging, in tension, or converging (see [harvest-nudge.md](harvest-nudge.md) for the arc, and [discovery-guidelines.md](discovery-guidelines.md) → *Reading Convergence* for the proxies). When it converges:

   → Load **[harvest-nudge.md](harvest-nudge.md)** and follow its instructions to surface the ambient nudge, then **stay in B** and keep exploring.

   Convergence cues the nudge; it does **not** trigger synthesis. Only the user's pull (step 2) routes to **C**.

5. **Keep the running record.** The **Exploration** section is a constant running record of the conversation — not verbatim, but **not summarised away; nothing of substance is lost.** Write to it at natural pauses (a thread worked through, the conversation about to branch, detail accumulating, context-compaction risk). Capture the journey: the ideas, the objections, the pivots, the route taken, the **false paths and failed designs** (with why they were dropped), the soft decisions reached, and the **answers to any research or investigation done in-session**. Append-forward — add depth by **layering down**, never by editing earlier entries back. Prose, not transcript; the log survives context refresh, in-context memory does not. Lossiness defeats the point: if the detail of the discovery is lost, the session was wasted.

   The lazy-creation rule applies: this may create the session log file if it doesn't exist yet — see [template.md](template.md) → *Lazy creation and finalisation*, which opens the session via `engine discovery-session open` (installing the log and setting the active-session marker). After writing, commit:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "discovery({work_unit}): exploration notes — session-{session_number:03d}" --discovery
   ```

→ On return, proceed to **C. Harvest** when the user pulls the harvest (a harvest pull recognised in step 2). Otherwise loop within **B** — convergence (step 4) cues the nudge but stays in the loop.

## C. Harvest

Reached from **B** step 2 when the user pulls the harvest. Synthesis is user-pulled — there is no Claude-side gate here; the user has already asked.

→ Load **[topic-synthesis.md](topic-synthesis.md)** and follow its instructions as written. It owns its own confirmation (`y` / `explore` / `adjust`) and returns a synthesis outcome:

#### If the outcome is `confirmed`

→ Return to caller.

#### If the outcome is `explore`

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.
