# Display: Specs Menu

*Reference for **[workflow-specification-entry](../SKILL.md)***

---

Shows when materialized specifications exist and no proposed groupings remain (every grouping has already been started). The tree, the menu, and the `ACTIONS` table share one ordering and numbering; concluded specs live behind `c/completed`.

## A. Display and Menu

Render the scoped snapshot:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-specification-entry/scripts/gateway.cjs view {work_unit}
```

Emit the TITLE section, then the DISPLAY section, then the MENU section, each verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Handle Selection**.

## B. Handle Selection

Match the user's input to its `ACTIONS` entry — a number or a command option's letter by `key`, its long form by `word`. Every decision below reads the entry's `action` value, never its label text.

#### If `action` is `analyze`

→ Load **[analysis-flow.md](analysis-flow.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### If `action` is `continue_spec`

The entry's `topic` and `verb`, plus that spec's DATA detail (sources, consult references), become the context for confirmation.

→ Load **[confirm-and-handoff.md](confirm-and-handoff.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, return to **A. Display and Menu**.

#### If `action` is `blocked_spec`

The spec's source discussions reopened — it cannot be entered until they re-conclude. Tell the user in one line which discussions hold it (the spec's `blocked_by` in DATA names them) and that concluding those unlocks the spec, then re-present.

→ Return to **A. Display and Menu**.

#### If `action` is `completed_menu`

→ Load **[display-completed-specs.md](display-completed-specs.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, return to **A. Display and Menu**.
