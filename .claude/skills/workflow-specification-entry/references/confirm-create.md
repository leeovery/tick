# Confirm: Create Specification

*Reference for **[confirm-and-handoff.md](confirm-and-handoff.md)***

---

**Consult references** — if the selected grouping owes any (a `**Consult**` line in the consolidation-analysis doc, or a `consult_references` entry on the spec), append this block to the confirmation below, after the sources listing; omit it when there are none:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Consult references (read narrowly — do not extract):
  • {ref-topic} — {slice hint}
```

## A. Display Confirmation

#### If no source discussions have individual specs

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Creating specification: {Title Case Name}

Sources:
  • {discussion-name}
  • {discussion-name}

Output: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**`◆ Proceed?`**

**`y/yes`**
**`n/no`**
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Handle Response**.

#### If any source discussion has an individual spec

The DATA `discussions:` lines mark this (`individual spec: {status}`). It is computed proposed-blind — a discussion that appears only in a proposed grouping does not count as having an individual spec, so a proposed item never lands here for supersession.

Note the supersession:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Creating specification: {Title Case Name}

Sources:
  • {discussion-name} (has individual spec — will be incorporated)
  • {discussion-name}

Output: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md

After completion:
  .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{source-topic}/specification.md → marked as superseded
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**`◆ Proceed?`**

**`y/yes`**
**`n/no`**
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Handle Response**.

## B. Handle Response

#### If `yes`

**If any source discussions have individual specs:**

→ Load **[create-with-incorporation.md](handoffs/create-with-incorporation.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

**Otherwise:**

→ Load **[create.md](handoffs/create.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### If `no`

**If single discussion (no menu to return to):**

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Understood. Continue working on discussions, or re-run this command when ready.
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

**If groupings or specs menu:**

→ Return to caller.
