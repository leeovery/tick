Act as **precise intake coordinator**. Follow each step literally without interpretation. Do not engage with the subject matter — your role is preparation, not processing.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Workflow Context

You are in the **Specification** phase — refining prior work into a standalone spec. Where Specification sits in the pipeline depends on the work type:

| Work type | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| Epic | Discovery → Research → (Experiment) → Discussion → **Specification** → Planning → Implementation → Review |
| Feature | Discussion → **Specification** → Planning → Implementation → Review |
| Bugfix | Investigation → **Specification** → Planning → Implementation → Review |
| Cross-cutting | Research (optional) → (Experiment) → Discussion → **Specification** (terminal) |

**Stay in your lane**: Validate and refine discussion content into standalone specifications. Don't jump to planning, phases, tasks, or code. The specification is the "line in the sand" - everything after this has hard dependencies on it.

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

Arguments: work_type = `$0`, work_unit = `$1`, topic = `$2` (optional).
Resolve topic: topic = `$2`, or if not provided and work_type is not `epic`, topic = `$1`.

Store work_unit for the handoff.

#### If `topic` resolved

→ Proceed to **Step 2** (Validate Source Material).

#### If no `topic` (epic — scoped path)

Render the scoped snapshot:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-specification-entry/scripts/gateway.cjs view {work_unit}
```

The output is one snapshot in up to three demarcated sections:

- **DATA** — reasoning surface: `scenario`, counts, `cache_status`, `discussions_checksum`, the discussion/specification detail (statuses, sources, consult references with slice hints), and — for scenarios with a menu — the `ACTIONS` key table (`key  action  topic  verb`). Reason from it; never display or restate it.
- **TITLE** / **DISPLAY** / **MENU** — the scenario's rendered surfaces. Never emitted from this call: the display reference each scenario routes to re-runs the view at its own emission point and emits from that response.

A section is everything beneath its `===` marker up to the next marker — the marker lines themselves are never emitted.

**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY this script for discovery. Do NOT run additional bash commands (ls, head, cat, etc.) to gather state.

→ Proceed to **Step 5** (Check Prerequisites).

---

## Step 2: Validate Source Material

Load **[validate-source.md](references/validate-source.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Validate Phase

Load **[validate-phase.md](references/validate-phase.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Invoke the Skill

Load **[invoke-skill.md](references/invoke-skill.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

This skill ends. The invoked skill will load into context and provide additional instructions. Terminal.

---

## Step 5: Check Prerequisites

Load **[check-prerequisites.md](references/check-prerequisites.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Route Based on State

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Route Based on State`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Evaluating what discussions and specifications exist to determine next steps.
```

Load **[route-scenario.md](references/route-scenario.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
