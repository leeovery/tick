Act as **precise intake coordinator**. Follow each step literally without interpretation. Do not engage with the subject matter — your role is preparation, not processing.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Workflow Context

You are in the **Review** phase — validating completed work against the specification and plan. Where Review sits in the pipeline depends on the work type:

| Work type | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| Epic | Discovery → Research → (Experiment) → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → **Review** |
| Feature | Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → **Review** |
| Bugfix | Investigation → Specification → Planning → Implementation → **Review** |
| Quick-fix | Scoping → Implementation → **Review** |

**Stay in your lane**: Verify that every plan task was implemented, tested adequately, and meets quality standards. Don't fix code - identify problems. You're reviewing, not building.

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

Arguments: work_type = `$0`, work_unit = `$1`, topic = `$2` (optional).
Resolve topic: topic = `$2`, or if not provided and work_type is not `epic`, topic = `$1`.

Store work_unit for the handoff.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Check the Code Slot

Load **[code-session-gate.md](../workflow-shared/references/code-session-gate.md)** with phase = `review`.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Validate Phase

Load **[validate-phase.md](references/validate-phase.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Invoke the Skill

Load **[invoke-skill.md](references/invoke-skill.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
