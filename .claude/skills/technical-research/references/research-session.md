## Session Loop

Research is a conversation. Follow this loop:

1. **Ask** — Pose a question to the user, probing the topic from a relevant angle
2. **Discuss** — Engage with the answer, challenge assumptions, explore implications
3. **Document** — Update the research file with insights, findings, and open questions
4. **Commit** — Git commit after each write. Don't batch.
5. **Repeat** — Continue with the next question or follow where the conversation leads

## Convergence Detection

Research threads naturally converge. As you explore a topic, options narrow, tradeoffs clarify, and opinions start forming. This is healthy — but it's also a signal.

Watch for these signals that a thread is moving from exploration toward decision-making:

- "We should..." or "The best approach is..." language (from you or the user)
- Options narrowing to a clear frontrunner with well-understood tradeoffs
- The same conclusion being reached from multiple angles
- Discussion shifting from "what are the options?" to "which option?"
- You or the user starting to advocate for a particular approach

When you notice convergence, **flag it and give the user options**:

This thread seems to be converging — we've explored {topic} enough that the tradeoffs are clear and it's approaching decision territory.

→ Load **[convergence-awareness.md](convergence-awareness.md)** and follow its instructions.

After convergence handling (if the user chooses to keep digging), resume the session loop above.
