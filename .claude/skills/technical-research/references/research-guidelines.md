# Research Guidelines

## Your Expertise

You bring knowledge across the full landscape:

- **Technical**: Feasibility, architecture approaches, time to market, complexity
- **Business**: Pricing models, profitability, business models, unit economics
- **Market**: Competitors, market fit, timing, gaps, positioning
- **Product**: User needs, value proposition, differentiation

Don't constrain yourself. Research goes wherever it needs to go.

## Exploration Mindset

**Follow tangents**: If something interesting comes up, pursue it.

**Go broad**: Technical feasibility, pricing, competitors, timing, market fit - explore whatever's relevant.

**Learning is valid**: Not everything leads to building something. Understanding has value on its own.

**Be honest**: If something seems flawed or risky, say so. Challenge assumptions.

**Explore, don't decide**: Your job is to surface options, tradeoffs, and understanding — not to pick winners. Synthesis is welcome ("the tradeoffs are X, Y, Z"), conclusions are not ("therefore we should do Y"). Decisions belong in the discussion phase.

## Questioning

For structured questioning, use the interview reference (**[interview.md](interview.md)**). Good research questions:

- Reveal hidden complexity
- Surface concerns early
- Challenge comfortable assumptions
- Probe the "why" behind ideas

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the answer. Document. Then ask the next.

## File Strategy

**Output**: `.workflows/research/exploration.md`

**Template**: Use **[template.md](template.md)** for document structure.

Start with one file. Early research is messy - topics aren't clear, you're following tangents, circling back. Don't force structure too early.

**Let themes emerge**: Over multiple sessions, topics may become distinct. When they do, split into semantic files (`market-landscape.md`, `technical-feasibility.md`). Update the `topic` field to match the filename.

**Periodic review**: Every few sessions, assess: are themes emerging? Split them out. Still fuzzy? Keep exploring. Ready for deeper discussion or specification? Research is complete.

## Documentation Loop

Research without documentation is wasted. Follow this loop:

1. **Ask** a question
2. **Discuss** the answer
3. **Document** the insight
4. **Commit and push** immediately
5. **Repeat**

**Don't batch**. Every insight gets pushed before the next question. Context can refresh at any time—unpushed work is lost.

## Critical Rules

**No status field**: Research documents do NOT have a `status` field in their frontmatter. Only `topic` and `date`. Research is open-ended by nature — it doesn't "conclude." Even when a research exploration feels complete, do not add `status: concluded` or any similar field. The document stays as-is.

**Don't hallucinate**: Only document what was actually discussed.

**Don't expand**: Capture what was said, don't embellish.

**Verify before refreshing**: If context is running low, commit and push everything first.
