# Research Document Template

Use this template when creating research documents.

## Template

```markdown
---
topic: exploration
date: YYYY-MM-DD  # Use today's actual date
---

# Research: {Title}

Brief description of what this research covers and what prompted it.

## Starting Point

What we know so far:
- {Initial thoughts or context from the user}
- {Any constraints or existing knowledge}
- {Where we're starting: technical, market, business, etc.}

---

{Content follows - freeform, managed by the skill}
```

## Field Notes

- `topic`: Use `exploration` for the initial exploration file. Use semantic names (`market-landscape`, `technical-feasibility`) when splitting into focused files.
- `date`: Today's date when creating the document.

## Notes

- The "Starting Point" section captures context from the initial conversation
- Content after that is intentionally unstructured - let themes emerge naturally
- When splitting into topic files, update the `topic` field to match the filename
- The skill handles content organization during sessions
