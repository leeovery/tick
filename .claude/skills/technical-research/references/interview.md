# Interview Mode

Focused questioning to probe ideas more deeply during research.

## Process

1. **Check existing context**: Read docs in `docs/workflow/research/` to understand what's already been explored.

2. **Begin interviewing**: Use the AskUserQuestion tool to probe the idea. Focus on:
   - Non-obvious questions (not things already answered)
   - Assumptions and unstated constraints
   - Tradeoffs and concerns
   - What could go wrong
   - The "why" behind decisions

3. **Go where it leads**: Follow tangents if they reveal something valuable. This isn't a checklist - it's a conversation.

4. **Document as you go**: Don't defer writing to the end. Capture insights in `docs/workflow/research/` using semantic filenames. Ask before documenting: "Shall I capture that?"

5. **Commit frequently**: At natural breaks and before context refresh.

6. **Exit when done**: The user decides when the interview is complete.

## Question Quality

Aim for questions that:
- The user hasn't already answered
- Reveal hidden complexity
- Surface concerns early
- Challenge comfortable assumptions

Avoid:
- Restating what's already documented
- Obvious surface-level questions
- Leading questions that assume an answer
