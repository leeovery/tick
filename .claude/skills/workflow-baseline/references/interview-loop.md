# Interview

*Reference for **[workflow-baseline](../SKILL.md)***

---

Walk the areas' agendas with the user, one themed round at a time, recording every answer as it lands. The interview is exitable at any moment — progress is written per round and an abandoned session resumes exactly where it stopped.

## A. Position

Read the area map:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get project.baseline.areas
```

#### If any area is `pending`

Research hasn't covered it yet.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 2**.

#### If any area is `completed`

A resumed interview — fetch the progress snapshot and emit its `DISPLAY: baseline progress` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render baseline-progress
```

→ Proceed to **B. Next Area**.

#### Otherwise

A fresh interview — render nothing.

→ Proceed to **B. Next Area**.

## B. Next Area

Pick the next `researched` area — `overview` first (its answers frame everything after it), then `boundaries`, then `glossary`, then the concern areas, most load-bearing first.

#### If none remain

Every area is `completed`.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block) — `{n}` is this area's position across all areas, `{total}` the area count:*

```
**`□ Interviewing {area:(titlecase)} ({n} of {total})`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> {One line: what this area covers and what the questions are after.} Answer in your own words, pick a candidate, or say "don't know" — an unanswered question is recorded as open, never guessed at.
```

→ Proceed to **C. Rounds**.

## C. Rounds

Read the area's agenda (`.workflows/.baseline/.state/agenda-{area}.md`) and interview in rounds until no `pending` questions remain:

1. **Compose the round** — 1–4 pending questions that are independent of one another. A question whose premises could be reshaped by another's answer waits for a later round.
2. **Ask conversationally** — per question: the observation first, then the ask. Evidence is what jogs memory ("why polling?" retrieves nothing; "the dispatcher polls behind four separate guards — that layering usually accretes from incidents; what's the story?" retrieves everything), and a wrong candidate jogs memory better than an open prompt. Write the round payload to `.workflows/.cache/baseline/round.json` with the Write tool — `{"area": "{area}", "questions": [{"text": "{the question, evidence woven in}", "candidates": ["{plausible answer}", "…"]}]}` — then fetch the round and emit its `DISPLAY: baseline round` section verbatim per its marker:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render baseline-round --file .workflows/.cache/baseline/round.json
   ```

   **STOP.** Wait for user response.

3. **Record the round** — immediately after the answers land, update each asked question in the agenda file: `**Status**: pending` becomes `answered` with an `**Answer**: {the user's answer — their words, condensed without being flattened}` line, or `open` when they don't know or it doesn't matter. An answer that contradicts an observed claim is noted on the question (`**Correction**: …`) for the doc weave. This write is the ledger — it happens every round, before anything else.
4. **Follow the thread when it earns it** — an answer that opens real ground (an incident story, a rejected alternative, a constraint nobody wrote down) is worth one conversational follow-up before the next round. Capture what it yields on the same agenda entry. One follow-up, not an interrogation spiral.

#### If the user asks to stop

However phrased — "pause", "that's enough for now", "let's pick this up later" — record any answers the same message carried first.

→ Proceed to **E. Pause**.

#### If pending questions remain

Next round.

→ Return to **C. Rounds**.

#### If the agenda is drained

→ Proceed to **D. Close the Area**.

## D. Close the Area

→ Load **[author-doc.md](author-doc.md)** with area = `{area}`.

On return, the area doc is written, indexed, and committed. Re-read the area map to see what remains:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get project.baseline.areas
```

#### If areas remain

Fetch the gate and emit its `MENU: baseline area gate` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render baseline-area-gate --area {area}
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **B. Next Area**.

**If `pause`:**

→ Proceed to **E. Pause**.

#### If no areas remain

→ Return to **B. Next Area**.

## E. Pause

Commit whatever the ledger holds:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --workflows -m "baseline: pause the interview"
```

Fetch the pause receipt and emit its `DISPLAY: baseline paused` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render baseline-paused
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.
