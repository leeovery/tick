Invoke the **technical-research** skill for this conversation.

## Workflow Context

This is **Phase 1** of the six-phase workflow:

| Phase             | Focus                                              | You    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **1. Research**   | EXPLORE - ideas, feasibility, market, business     | ◀ HERE |
| 2. Discussion     | WHAT and WHY - decisions, architecture, edge cases |        |
| 3. Specification  | REFINE - validate into standalone spec             |        |
| 4. Planning       | HOW - phases, tasks, acceptance criteria           |        |
| 5. Implementation | DOING - tests first, then code                     |        |
| 6. Review         | VALIDATING - check work against artifacts          |        |

**Stay in your lane**: Explore freely. This is the time for broad thinking, feasibility checks, and learning. Surface options and tradeoffs — don't make decisions. When a topic converges toward a conclusion, that's a signal it's ready for discussion phase, not a cue to start deciding. Park it and move on.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them. Present output using the EXACT format shown in examples - do not simplify or alter the formatting.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Even if the user's initial prompt seems to answer a question, still confirm with them at the appropriate step
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Do not act on gathered information until the skill is loaded - it contains the instructions for how to proceed

## Step 0: Run Migrations

**This step is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Invoke the `/migrate` skill and assess its output.

#### If files were updated

**STOP.** Wait for the user to review the changes (e.g., via `git diff`) and confirm before proceeding.

#### If no updates needed

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

---

## Step 1: Check Arguments

Check for arguments: work_type = `$0`. If provided, store for the handoff.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Gather Context

Load **[gather-context.md](references/gather-context.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

  ".workflows/research/{topic}.md"
```
