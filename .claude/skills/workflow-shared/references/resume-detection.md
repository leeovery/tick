# Resume Detection

*Shared reference for processing skills.*

Read `{file}`.

**If `artifact` is `research`, `discussion`, or `investigation`**, read the topic's triage queue — `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic queue {work_unit} {artifact} {topic}`. When `count` is non-zero, the entries are concerns rerouted here from other topics — their origin sessions recorded them as landed. Restart preserves the queue (it is not a restart target), but the count belongs in the gate: set `{N}` = `count` and pass `--triage {N}` below. Omit the flag when the count is zero or the artifact has no queue.

Render the gate:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render resume-gate {work_unit}.{artifact}.{topic} [--triage {N}]
```

Emit each returned section verbatim at its marked instruction — the triage warning (when present) directly above the menu.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `continue`

→ Return to caller for **{continue_step}**. The steps before it are the fresh path's — the artifact's existence means they already ran.

#### If `restart`

1. Delete {restart_targets}
2. Reset {restart_resets} — only when the caller passed `restart_resets`; skip otherwise. Deleting artifacts while their manifest tracking rows stay satisfied would leave the fresh run believing that work already happened.
3. Commit the deletions and the reset on the topic's own scope:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} --topic {artifact}/{topic} -m "{commit}"
   ```

→ Return to caller for **Step 1**.
