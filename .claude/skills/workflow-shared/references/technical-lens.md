# Technical-Lens Presentation

*Shared reference. Loaded by `findings-signoff.md` and `raising-a-decision.md` when the user asks for the technical perspective.*

---

The code-perspective counterpart to [product-lens.md](product-lens.md): the same record retold from the code's side. A perspective shift, not a dump — never raw file contents, never a jargon chain.

Engine-emitted sections sit outside it entirely: `=== DISPLAY … ===` and `=== MENU … ===` content is emitted byte-for-byte, and a gate re-emitted after a retell is not part of the retelling. The register stops at the section boundary.

This file composes with [voice.md](voice.md) rather than competing: this governs the record's shape and fidelity, voice governs how the sentences sound.

## Audience

The same engineer — knows the product, and is now asking how the code produces what they saw. Full engineering fluency; codebase structures are introduced as the story needs them, then called by their real names.

## Register

- **Lead with the mechanism.** The code path, state, or interaction that produces the behaviour — what runs, in what order, and where it goes wrong.
- **Narrative markdown prose**, not fixed-width fragments in a code block. Bold section leads are fine.
- **Real names, woven in.** Files, functions, and flags with `file:line` form the spine here — carried in sentences, not bare lists.
- **Behaviour stays attached.** Each mechanism ties back to what it produces in the product; the manifestation anchors the story it no longer leads.

## Fidelity

A retelling, not a summary — every substantive point in the underlying record appears; nothing softened, nothing dropped. This is the detail path the product-facing presentation defers to. The record file stays authoritative.
