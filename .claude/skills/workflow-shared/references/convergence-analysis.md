# Convergence Analysis

*Shared reference for review/fix cycle escalation.*

---

When a review or fix cycle reaches its escalation threshold, read prior cycle tracking data and present a diagnostic showing what's converging, what's stuck, and why.

## Parameters

The caller provides these via context before loading:

- `loop_type` — `fix` | `analysis` | `planning-review` | `spec-review`
- `work_unit` — the work unit name
- `topic` — the topic name
- `internal_id` — (fix loop only) the task's internal ID

## Threshold Check

Cross-cycle analysis requires at least 2 data points. Determine the number of available cycles from how the loop type stores them: the `fix` loop appends every cycle as an `## Attempt {N}` section inside its single tracking file — count those sections; the other three loop types write numbered `-c{N}` files, up to one per stream per cycle — count the **distinct `{N}` suffixes**, never the files.

#### If fewer than 2 cycles of data exist

→ Return to caller.

#### If 2 or more cycles of data exist

→ Proceed to **A. Gather Cycle Data**.

---

## A. Gather Cycle Data

Read tracking data from all available cycles. Extract only finding titles, key identifiers, and resolutions — not full content. Record the highest cycle number found as `latest_cycle`.

#### If `loop_type` is `fix`

Read the fix tracking file:
```
.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/fix-tracking-{internal_id}.md
```

For each `## Attempt {N}` section, extract:
- Each ISSUE entry (the issue description line and file:line reference)
- The CONFIDENCE level per issue

→ Proceed to **B. Classify Findings**.

#### If `loop_type` is `analysis`

Read analysis reports and task staging files for all available cycles:
```
.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-report-c{1..N}.md
.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{1..N}.md
```

For each cycle, extract:
- From the report's **Stats** section: total findings, deduplicated findings, proposed tasks
- From the staging file: each task's title, severity, and sources; its approved/skipped outcome from the manifest's `staging.c{N}.tasks` (`manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging`)

→ Proceed to **B. Classify Findings**.

#### If `loop_type` is `planning-review`

Read tracking files for all available cycles:
```
.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/review-traceability-tracking-c{1..N}.md
.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/review-integrity-tracking-c{1..N}.md
```

For each cycle, extract:
- Each finding's title
- Which stream it came from (traceability or integrity — by tracking file)
- Plan Reference field (which plan area is affected)
- Resolution (Fixed/Declined — legacy files write Skipped, read it as Declined)

→ Proceed to **B. Classify Findings**.

#### If `loop_type` is `spec-review`

Read tracking files for all available cycles:
```
.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/review-claims-tracking-c{1..N}.md
.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/review-input-tracking-c{1..N}.md
.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/review-gap-analysis-tracking-c{1..N}.md
```

For each cycle, extract:
- Each finding's title
- Which stream it came from (claims, input review, or gap analysis — by tracking file)
- Affects field (which specification section)
- Category
- Resolution (Approved/Adjusted/Declined/Routed — legacy files write Skipped, read it as Declined)

Also read the document-growth pair — the construction baseline (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} review_baseline_words`) and the live count as `live_words` (`wc -w < .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`). An absent baseline skips the growth line and its note.

→ Proceed to **B. Classify Findings**.

---

## B. Classify Findings

Compare findings across cycles. Two findings match if their titles share significant words OR they reference the same area (file:line, plan reference, or spec section).

Treat the highest-numbered cycle as the **latest cycle** and all earlier cycles as **prior cycles**. For each finding identified across all cycles, classify as:

- **Resolved** — appeared in a prior cycle but not in the latest cycle (the underlying issue was addressed)
- **Recurring** — appeared in 2 or more cycles including the latest one (the issue persists despite fixes)
- **New** — first appearance in the latest cycle

Compute:
- `resolved_count` — findings from prior cycles no longer appearing
- `recurring_count` — findings persisting across cycles
- `new_count` — findings appearing for the first time in the latest cycle
- `stream_counts` — (multi-stream loop types only: `spec-review`, `planning-review`) latest-cycle finding counts per tracking stream, rendered `{label} {count}` and ` · `-joined in stream order
- `review_growth` — (`spec-review` only, when the baseline exists) `live_words` minus `review_baseline_words`, sign and all: the net text review has added. Growth from source material being pulled in is the loop working; growth while findings churn is the loop reviewing its own writing — the trend beside it says which
- `trend` (first match wins):
  - **churning** — recurring_count is 0 or near 0 while resolved_count and new_count are both above 0 and roughly equal (every cycle's findings are new — the edits themselves are generating them)
  - **converging** — resolved_count > new_count (progress is being made)
  - **stable** — resolved_count ≈ new_count (treading water)
  - **diverging** — new_count > resolved_count (fixes are creating new issues)

→ Proceed to **C. Display Diagnostic**.

## C. Display Diagnostic

Open with one markdown sentence above the block — what the cycles show, in plain terms: what is resolving and what keeps coming back.

Write the payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/{phase}/{topic}/convergence-diagnostic.json` with the Write tool — classification is yours, arithmetic and flags are the surface's. `{phase}` is the loop's own: `implementation` for `fix` and `analysis`, `planning` for `planning-review`, `specification` for `spec-review`.

```json
{"loop_type": "…", "latest_cycle": N, "trend": "…", "resolved": [{"title": "…", "last_seen_cycle": N}], "recurring": [{"title": "…", "cycles": "3, 4", "hypothesis": "…"}], "new": [{"title": "…"}]}
```

- `loop_type`, `latest_cycle`, `trend` — from **A** and **B**.
- `resolved` / `recurring` / `new` — the classified findings; each recurring entry carries its cycle list and a 1-line root-cause `hypothesis` in plain behaviour terms, from the finding's history and affected area.
- `stream_counts` — multi-stream loop types only (`spec-review`, `planning-review`): one `{"label": "…", "count": N}` per tracking stream, in stream order. Stream labels: `spec-review` → `claims` / `input review` / `gap analysis`; `planning-review` → `traceability` / `integrity`.
- `review_baseline_words` and `live_words` — `spec-review` only, when the baseline exists; omit both otherwise.

Fetch the diagnostic and emit its section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render convergence-diagnostic {work_unit}.{phase}.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/{phase}/{topic}/convergence-diagnostic.json
```

→ Return to caller.
