Continue an in-progress epic. Shows full phase-by-phase state and routes to the appropriate phase skill.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

---

## Step 0: Run Migrations

**This step is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Invoke the `/migrate` skill and assess its output.

---

## Step 1: Discovery State

!`node .claude/skills/continue-epic/scripts/discovery.js`

If the above shows a script invocation rather than discovery output, the dynamic content preprocessor did not run. Execute the script before continuing:

```bash
node .claude/skills/continue-epic/scripts/discovery.js
```

If discovery output is already displayed, it has been run on your behalf.

Parse the discovery output to understand:

**From `epics` array:** Each epic has:
- `name` - the work unit name
- `active_phases` - list of phase names that have artifacts
- `detail` - full phase-by-phase breakdown containing:
  - `phases` - per-phase items with statuses and spec sources
  - `in_progress` - items currently in-progress (name + phase)
  - `concluded` - items that are concluded/completed (name + phase)
  - `next_phase_ready` - items ready for the next phase (name + action + label)
  - `unaccounted_discussions` - concluded discussions not sourced in any spec
  - `reopened_discussions` - in-progress discussions that are sourced in a spec
  - `gating` - boolean flags for phase-forward gating

**From top-level fields:**
- `count` - number of active epics
- `summary` - human-readable state summary

**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY this script for discovery. Do NOT run additional bash commands (ls, head, cat, etc.) to gather state.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Check Count and Arguments

#### If `count` is 0

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Continue Epic

No epics in progress.

Run /start-epic to begin a new one.
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

#### If `work_unit` argument `$0` provided

Store the work_unit.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

#### If `work_unit` not provided

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Select Epic

Load **[select-epic.md](references/select-epic.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Validate Selection

Load **[validate-selection.md](references/validate-selection.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Display State and Menu

Load **[display-and-menu.md](references/display-and-menu.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Route Selection

#### If user selected "Resume a concluded topic"

Load **[resume-concluded.md](references/resume-concluded.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### Otherwise

Invoke the appropriate skill based on the user's menu selection:

| Menu option | Invoke |
|-------------|--------|
| Continue {topic} — discussion | `/start-discussion epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Continue {topic} — research | `/start-research epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Continue {topic} — specification | `/start-specification epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Continue {topic} — planning | `/start-planning epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Continue {topic} — implementation | `/start-implementation epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Start planning for {topic} | `/start-planning epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Start implementation of {topic} | `/start-implementation epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Start review for {topic} | `/start-review epic {work_unit} {topic}` |
| Start specification | `/start-specification epic {work_unit}` |
| Start new discussion topic | `/start-discussion epic {work_unit}` |
| Start new research | `/start-research epic {work_unit}` |

Skills receive positional arguments: `$0` = work_type (`epic`), `$1` = work_unit, `$2` = topic (when provided).

This skill ends. The invoked skill will load into context and provide additional instructions. Terminal.
