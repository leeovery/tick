```

#### If status is `completed`

Reset to in-progress:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.research.{topic} status in-progress
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Reopening research: {topic:(titlecase)}
```

Set source="continue".

→ Return to caller.

#### If status is `in-progress`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Resuming research: {topic:(titlecase)}
```

Set source="continue".

→ Return to caller.
