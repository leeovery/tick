# Invoke the Skill

*Reference for **[workflow-implementation-entry](../SKILL.md)***

---

This skill's purpose is now fulfilled. Construct the handoff and invoke the processing skill.

## Handoff

Query format and external_id from manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
```

Check if implementation already exists:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest exists {work_unit}.implementation.{topic}
```

Invoke the **workflow-implementation-process** skill (Skill tool) with the next fenced block as its arguments. Do not act on the gathered context until its instructions load — the skill defines the process.

```
Implementation session for: {topic}
Work unit: {work_unit}

Format: {format}
External ID: {external_id} (if applicable)
Specification: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md (exists: {true|false})
Implementation: {exists:[true|false]}

Dependencies: {All satisfied | List any notes}
```
