node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
```

Check if implementation already exists:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {work_unit}.implementation.{topic}
```

```
Implementation session for: {topic}
Work unit: {work_unit}

Format: {format}
External ID: {external_id} (if applicable)
Specification: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md (exists: {true|false})
Implementation: {exists:[true|false]}

Dependencies: {All satisfied | List any notes}
Environment: {Setup required | No special setup required}

Invoke the workflow-implementation-process skill.
