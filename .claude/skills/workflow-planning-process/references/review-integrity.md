# Plan Integrity Review

*Reference for **[plan-review](plan-review.md)***

---

Review the plan **as a standalone document** for structural quality, implementation readiness, and adherence to planning standards.

**Purpose**: Ensure that the plan itself is well-structured, complete, and ready for implementation. An implementer (human or AI) should be able to pick up this plan and execute it without ambiguity, without needing to make design decisions, and without referring back to the specification.

**Key distinction**: The traceability review checked *what's in the plan* against the spec. This review checks *how it's structured* — looking inward at the plan's own quality.

Read the plan end-to-end — carefully, as if you were about to implement it. For each phase, each task, and the plan overall, check against the following criteria:

## What You're NOT Doing

- **Not redesigning the plan** — You're checking quality, not re-architecting
- **Not adding content from outside the spec** — If a task needs more detail, the detail must come from the specification
- **Not gold-plating** — Focus on issues that would actually impact implementation
- **Not second-guessing phase structure** — Unless it's fundamentally broken, the structure stands

## What to Look For

1. **Task Template Compliance**
   - Every task has all required fields: Problem, Solution, Outcome, Do, Acceptance Criteria, Tests
   - Problem statements clearly explain WHY the task exists
   - Solution statements describe WHAT we're building
   - Outcome statements define what success looks like
   - Acceptance criteria are concrete and verifiable (not vague)
   - Tests include edge cases, not just happy paths

2. **Vertical Slicing**
   - Tasks deliver complete, testable functionality
   - No horizontal slicing (all models, then all services, then all wiring)
   - Each task can be verified independently
   - Each task is a single TDD cycle

3. **Phase Structure**
   - Phases follow logical progression (Foundation → Core → Edge cases → Refinement)
   - Each phase has clear acceptance criteria
   - Each phase is independently testable
   - Phase boundaries make sense (not arbitrary groupings)

4. **Dependencies and Ordering**
   - Task dependencies are explicit and correct — each dependency reflects a genuine data or capability requirement
   - No circular dependencies exist in the task graph
   - Priority assignments reflect graph position — foundation tasks and tasks that unblock others are prioritised appropriately
   - Tasks within a phase execute in natural order (by internal ID) unless dependencies or priorities override it. Do not flag missing dependencies for sequential intra-phase tasks where natural order already produces the correct sequence. Only flag dependency issues where: execution would happen in the wrong order without an explicit dependency, a cross-phase dependency is missing, or a convergence point (task needing multiple predecessors) lacks explicit edges.

5. **Task Self-Containment**
   - Each task contains all context needed for execution
   - No task requires reading other tasks to understand what to do
   - Relevant specification decisions are pulled into task context
   - An implementer could pick up any single task and execute it

6. **Scope and Granularity**
   - Each task is one TDD cycle (not too large, not too small)
   - No task requires multiple unrelated implementation steps
   - No task is so granular it's just mechanical boilerplate

7. **Acceptance Criteria Quality**
   - Criteria are pass/fail, not subjective
   - Criteria cover the actual requirement, not just "code exists"
   - Edge case criteria are specific about boundary values and behaviors
   - No criteria that an implementer would have to interpret

8. **External Dependencies** (epic only — skip for feature/bugfix)
   - All external dependencies from the specification are documented in the plan
   - Dependencies are in the correct state (resolved/unresolved)
   - No external dependencies were missed or invented

## The Move

Every finding names the **move** it owes the reader — what they have to do about it. The move, never the category, decides how the finding is presented.

- **settled** — the record admits exactly one defensible answer. Write the **Proposal**: the call and what determined it. Most findings are this.
- **choice** — real options exist and only the reader can pick between them — a verdict earned by searching, never a default: anything the specification, the plan's own conventions, or a measurement yields is `settled`, that derivation its Proposal. It holds only where the fork is what the product's user gets or how it behaves, nothing in the specification, the plan's own conventions, or a measurement breaks the tie, a side visibly costs the user, and the tie-break is the reader's — appetite, product intent, or a fact only they hold. A fork in how the plan achieves it is the planner's, and a fork every side of which leaves the user well served is a preference, not a decision: either settles on what leans, and where nothing leans, on your honest call, the Proposal naming it as such and what it weighed. A staged choice names what was searched and where the record ran out. Write the **Options**, one line each, at most one marked `(recommended)`. Write no Proposal: a choice dressed as a decision already made is the failure this field exists to prevent.
- Planning findings never route: the plan is the document under review, and its answers live in the specification or the record.

A call you cannot yourself stand behind is a **choice**, never a settled answer written on the reader's behalf. A choice that names no search is re-derived from scratch: name it. A preference nothing leans on is settled on your honest call, never staged as a choice.

The **Problem** is what is wrong in the terms the reader cares about — the product, the end result. Never the analysis that found it, and never the document's own wording read back at them.

A plan defect the specification or the plan's own conventions determine is **settled**. A fork in how the plan achieves it — how to split a task, which phase owns a slice, what a consumer keys on — is settled too: on what leans, or on your honest call where nothing does. A **choice** is a fork in what the product's user gets that survives the search with a side visibly costing them: name what was searched, and take a stance.

## Tracking File

After completing the analysis, create a tracking file at `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/review-integrity-tracking-c{N}.md` (where N is the current review cycle).

Categorize each finding by severity:

- **Critical**: Would block implementation or cause incorrect behavior
- **Important**: Would force implementer to guess or make design decisions
- **Minor**: Polish or improvement that strengthens the plan

Tracking files are **never deleted** — pure markdown, no frontmatter; previous cycles' files persist as review history. The orchestrator records each file's gate state in the manifest (`tracking.{file stem}`: `in-progress` at dispatch, `complete` when all findings are processed).

**Format**:
```markdown
# Review Tracking: {Topic Name} - Integrity

## Findings

### 1. [Brief Title]

**Severity**: Critical | Important | Minor
**Plan Reference**: [Phase/task in plan]
**Category**: [Which review criterion — e.g., "Task Template Compliance", "Vertical Slicing"]
**Move**: settled | choice
**Change Type**: [update-task | add-to-task | remove-from-task | add-task | remove-task | add-phase | remove-phase]

**Problem**:
[What this would build wrong, or fail to build, in the terms the reader cares about. Name the consequence, not the criterion it failed.]

**Proposal**:
[Move `settled` — the fix and what determined it. Omit for `choice`.]

**Options**:
[Move `choice` — one line per option, "(recommended)" on at most one. Omit for `settled`.]

**Current**:
[Move `settled` only — the existing content as it appears in the plan. Omit for add-task/add-phase, and always for `choice`: a choice carries no fix content.]

**Proposed Text**:
[Move `settled` only — the replacement/new content in full plan format. Omit for remove-task/remove-phase, and always for `choice`: a choice carries no fix content. Older tracking files name this field **Proposed** — read both as the same field.]

**Resolution**: Pending
**Notes**:
