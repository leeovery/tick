# Define Tasks

*Reference for **[workflow-planning-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

This step uses the `workflow-planning-task-designer` agent (`../../../agents/workflow-planning-task-designer.md`) to design a task list for a single phase. You invoke the agent, present its output, and handle the approval gate.

---

## A. Design Task List

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Taking Phase {N}: {Phase Name} and breaking it into tasks. I'll delegate this to a specialist agent that will read the full specification and propose a task list.
```

### Invoke the Agent

Read `work_type` from the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit} work_type
```

Invoke `workflow-planning-task-designer` with these file paths:

1. **read-specification.md**: `read-specification.md`
2. **Specification**: specification path from the manifest or `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`
3. **Cross-cutting specs**: cross-cutting spec paths if any
4. **task-design.md**: `task-design.md`
5. **Context guidance**: `task-design/{work_type}.md` (default to `epic` if `work_type` is empty)
6. **All approved phases**: the complete phase structure from the planning file
7. **Target phase number**: the phase being broken into tasks

### Present the Output

The agent returns a task overview and task table. Write the task table to the planning file under the phase. Where the overview names work deferred to another phase, add that deferral to the receiving phase's **Acceptance** list in the same write.

Update the manifest planning position:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} phase {N}
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task '~'
```

Commit:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): draft Phase {N} task list" --topic planning/{topic}
```

Write the task-list payload for the render surface to the phase cache — one entry per task, each summary a single line, edge cases as short phrases:

```json
.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/task-list-phase-{N}.json
{"phase": {N}, "phase_name": "{Phase Name}", "tasks": [{"name": "…", "summary": "…", "edge_cases": ["…"]}]}
```

Use the Write tool for the payload — never a shell heredoc.

→ Proceed to **B. Render the Gate**.

---

## B. Render the Gate

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render task-list {work_unit}.planning.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/task-list-phase-{N}.json
```

The response carries the task-list display plus the surface for the current gate mode. Emit each section verbatim at its marked instruction.

#### If the response carried `DISPLAY: task list auto-approved`

→ Proceed to **C. Finalize Approval**.

#### If the response carried `MENU: task list gate`

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If the user provides feedback

Re-invoke `workflow-planning-task-designer` with all original inputs PLUS:
- **Previous output**: the current task list
- **User feedback**: what the user wants changed

Update the planning file with the revised task table, and rewrite the payload file to match.

→ Return to **B. Render the Gate**.

#### If `auto`

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_list_gate_mode auto
```

→ Proceed to **C. Finalize Approval**.

#### If navigate

Resolve the destination per the caller's **Navigation** section — the user's position moves, the leading edge does not.

→ Return to caller for **B. Process Current Phase**.

#### If `yes`

→ Proceed to **C. Finalize Approval**.

---

## C. Finalize Approval

**If the task list is new or was amended:**

1. Record the approval — `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} approvals.tasks.p{N} $(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
2. Advance the planning position in the manifest to the first task in this phase:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task {first_task_id}
   ```
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): approve Phase {N} task list" --topic planning/{topic}
   ```

If the manifest already carries `approvals.tasks.p{N}` and the list is unchanged, no updates are needed.

→ Return to caller.
