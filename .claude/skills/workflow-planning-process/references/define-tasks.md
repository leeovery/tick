# Define Tasks

*Reference for **[workflow-planning-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

This step uses the `workflow-planning-task-designer` agent (`../../../agents/workflow-planning-task-designer.md`) to design a task list for a single phase. You invoke the agent, present its output, and handle the approval gate.

---

## Design the Task List

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Taking Phase {N}: {Phase Name} and breaking it into tasks. I'll delegate
this to a specialist agent that will read the full specification and
propose a task list.
```

### Invoke the Agent

Read `work_type` from the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit} work_type
```

Invoke `workflow-planning-task-designer` with these file paths:

1. **read-specification.md**: `read-specification.md`
2. **Specification**: specification path from the manifest or `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`
3. **Cross-cutting specs**: cross-cutting spec paths if any
4. **task-design.md**: `task-design.md`
5. **Context guidance**: `task-design/{work_type}.md` (default to `epic` if `work_type` is empty)
6. **All approved phases**: the complete phase structure from the Plan Index File body
7. **Target phase number**: the phase being broken into tasks
8. **plan-index-schema.md**: `plan-index-schema.md`

### Present the Output

The agent returns a task overview and task table. Write the task table directly to the Plan Index File under the phase.

Update the manifest planning position:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} phase {N}
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task ~
```

Commit: `planning({work_unit}): draft Phase {N} task list`

Present the task overview to the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
{task overview from workflow-planning-task-designer agent}
```

Then check the gate mode.

### Check Gate Mode

Check `task_list_gate_mode` via manifest CLI:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_list_gate_mode
```

#### If `task_list_gate_mode: auto`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Phase {N}: {Phase Name} — task list approved. Proceeding to authoring.
```

→ Proceed to **If approved** below.

#### If `task_list_gate_mode: gated`

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Approve this task list?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Proceed to authoring
- **`a`/`auto`** — Approve this and all remaining task list gates automatically
- **Tell me what to change** — reorder, split, merge, add, edit, or remove tasks
- **Navigate** — a different phase or task, or the leading edge
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If the user provides feedback

Re-invoke `workflow-planning-task-designer` with all original inputs PLUS:
- **Previous output**: the current task list
- **User feedback**: what the user wants changed

Update the Plan Index File with the revised task table, re-present, and ask again. Repeat until approved.

#### If `auto`

Note that `task_list_gate_mode` should be updated to `auto` in the manifest during the commit step below.

→ Proceed to **If approved** below.

#### If approved (`y`/`yes` or `auto`)

**If the task list is new or was amended:**

1. Advance the planning position in the manifest to the first task in this phase:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task {first_task_id}
   ```
2. If user chose `auto` at this gate: update the manifest:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_list_gate_mode auto
   ```
3. Commit: `planning({work_unit}): approve Phase {N} task list`

If the task list was already approved and unchanged, no updates are needed.

→ Return to **[plan-construction.md](plan-construction.md)**.
