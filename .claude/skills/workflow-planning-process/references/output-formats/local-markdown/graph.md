# Local Markdown: Task Graph

Local markdown has no native dependency or priority engine. Both are stored as frontmatter fields on task files and used during task selection to determine execution order.

This file serves every consumer that sets priority or dependencies: the graphing agent after plan authoring, and the implementation flows adding or placing tasks mid-build.

## Priority

Any positive integer. Lower number = higher priority. `0` means no priority (unset).

### Setting Priority

Add or update the `priority` field in frontmatter:

```yaml
priority: 2
```

### Removing Priority

Set `priority: 0` or remove the `priority` field from frontmatter entirely.

## Dependencies

### Adding a Dependency

Add the blocking task's ID to the `depends_on` field in the dependent task's frontmatter:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - {topic}-1-2
```

A task can depend on multiple tasks:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - {topic}-1-2
  - {topic}-1-3
```

### Removing a Dependency

Remove the internal ID from the `depends_on` field. If the field becomes empty, remove it entirely.
