# Linear: Task Graph

Linear natively supports both priority levels and blocking relationships between issues. Both are used to determine execution order.

This file serves every consumer that sets priority or dependencies: the graphing agent after plan authoring, and the implementation flows adding or placing tasks mid-build.

## Priority

Linear uses fixed numeric priority values (0–4). The API normalises these to the workspace's display labels.

| Value | Level |
|-------|-------|
| `1` | Urgent |
| `2` | High |
| `3` | Medium |
| `4` | Low |
| `0` | No priority |

Lower number = higher priority. `0` means unset.

### Setting Priority

```
update_issue(
  issueId: "{issue_id}",
  priority: {priority_level}
)
```

### Removing Priority

```
update_issue(
  issueId: "{issue_id}",
  priority: 0
)
```

## Dependencies

> **Note**: Issue relation tools may not be available on all Linear MCP server implementations. Check available tools before proceeding. If relation tools are unavailable, document dependencies in task descriptions and rely on phase ordering and priority for execution order.

### Adding a Dependency

To declare that one task depends on another (is blocked by it):

```
create_issue_relation(
  issueId: "{dependent_issue_id}",
  relatedIssueId: "{blocking_issue_id}",
  type: "blocks"
)
```

A task can have multiple dependencies. Call `create_issue_relation` for each one.

### Removing a Dependency

Query the issue to find its relations, then delete the specific relation:

```
get_issue(issueId: "{issue_id}")
```

Look for the relation in the issue's relations list, then remove it using the relation ID.

> **Note**: The official Linear MCP server may not expose a relation-deletion tool. If none is available, ask the user to remove the relation in the Linear UI (issue → Relations), then confirm before proceeding.
