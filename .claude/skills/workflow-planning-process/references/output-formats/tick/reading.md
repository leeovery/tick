# Tick: Reading

## Identifiers

`<topic-tick-id>` is the plan's `external_id` in the manifest; phase and task tick IDs are recorded in `task_map` (internal ID → tick ID):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map
```

`tick list` output does not include refs — correlate internal IDs through `task_map`, or use `tick show <tick-id>` to see a single task's refs.

## Display Identifier

The identifier shown beside the internal id in user-facing task displays is the task's tick id — the plan's `task_map` entry for the internal id:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} task_map.{internal_id}
```

## Listing Tasks

To retrieve all tasks for a topic:

```bash
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id>
```

This returns all descendants (phases and tasks) with summary-level data: id, title, status, priority, and parent. Results are sorted by priority (ascending), then creation date.

To list tasks within a specific phase:

```bash
tick list --parent <phase-tick-id>
```

Additional filtering:

```bash
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id> --status open       # only open tasks
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id> --ready              # ready tasks only
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id> --blocked            # blocked tasks only
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id> --priority 0         # critical tasks only
tick list --parent <topic-tick-id> --count 5            # limit to 5 results
```

## Extracting a Task

To read full task detail including description, blockers, and children:

```bash
tick show <tick-id>
```

Returns: id, title, status, priority, created/updated timestamps, parent, blocked_by list, children list, and full description.

## Next Available Task

To find the next task to implement:

1. **Check for a task already in flight** — a prior session may have started a task and ended before completing it:

   ```bash
   tick list --parent <phase-tick-id> --status in_progress
   ```

   `tick start` cascades `in_progress` up the hierarchy, so containers appear alongside the task actually in flight. Exclude any result that has an `open` or `in_progress` child — check each result's children (`tick show <tick-id>`); the open children of a cascaded container are not themselves in this result set, so comparing results against each other is not enough. Only a childless-or-all-done result is resumable. If a task remains, it is the next task: it is already `in_progress` in tick, so skip the format's mark-in-progress transition — the engine `task start` still runs (its task record and gate bookkeeping are separate from tick status).

2. **Otherwise, take the next ready task:**

   ```bash
   tick ready --parent <phase-tick-id> --count 1
   ```

   This returns the single next task that is:

   1. Status is `open` (not started, not done, not cancelled)
   2. No unresolved blockers (all `blocked_by` tasks are `done`)
   3. No open children (leaf tasks, or parent tasks whose children are all complete)
   4. Within the specified phase (scoped by `--parent`)

   Results are sorted by priority (lower number = higher priority), then creation date. `--count 1` limits output to the first result.

To find the next task across all phases of a topic, run the same two checks with `--parent <topic-tick-id>`.

If neither check returns a task, either all tasks are complete or remaining tasks are blocked.

**Natural ordering convention**: `tick ready` always returns results in the correct execution order — by priority, then creation date. Consumers should take the first result as the next task. Because creation date preserves authoring order, sequential intra-phase tasks execute in natural order without needing explicit dependencies. Only add dependencies when the correct order differs from the natural order.
