All phases and tasks are written. Now I'll check for external dependencies — things this plan needs from other topics or systems.
```

Handle external dependencies — things this plan needs from other topics or systems.

Dependencies are stored in the **manifest** as `external_dependencies` (under `planning.{topic}`). See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for the format and states.

#### If the specification has a Dependencies section

→ Proceed to **A. Read Existing State**.

#### If the specification has no Dependencies section

This topic has no external dependencies. Other topics may still have unresolved dependencies pointing at this plan's tasks.

→ Proceed to **E. Reverse Check**.

---

## A. Read Existing State

Read existing `external_dependencies` from the manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies
```

#### If output is empty (no existing entries)

No existing entries to preserve.

→ Proceed to **B. Write Spec Dependencies**.

#### Otherwise

Note which topics have `state: satisfied_externally` — these must be preserved.

→ Proceed to **B. Write Spec Dependencies**.

---

## B. Write Spec Dependencies

Read the specification's Dependencies section. For each dependency, derive the manifest key from the dependency name as `{dep_topic:(kebabcase)}` and use the "Why Blocked" column as `{description}`. Write each to the manifest.

#### If an existing entry for this topic has `state: satisfied_externally`

Preserve the existing state — only update the description:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.description "{description}"
```

→ Proceed to **C. Remove Stale Entries**.

#### Otherwise

Set as unresolved:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.description "{description}"
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.state unresolved
```

→ Proceed to **C. Remove Stale Entries**.

---

## C. Remove Stale Entries

Compare the manifest's dependency topics against the specification's Dependencies section. Any manifest entry whose topic does not appear in the specification is stale — left over from a previous planning session.

#### If stale entries exist

Delete each one:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}
```

→ Proceed to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies**.

#### Otherwise

Nothing to remove.

→ Proceed to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies**.

---

## D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies

For each unresolved dependency, check if the planning entry exists in the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest exists {work_unit}.planning.{dep_topic}
```

#### If the plan does not exist

Leave the dependency as `state: unresolved`. It will be resolved when that topic is planned.

→ Return to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies** for the next unresolved dependency; when all have been checked, proceed to **E. Reverse Check**.

#### Otherwise

Read the plan's task table and find the task that best satisfies the dependency by matching the task name against the dependency description. Use the matched task's Internal ID from the plan table.

Add the resolution to the working list — persisted in one batch at **E**'s end:

- `{work_unit}.planning.{topic}` → `external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.state: resolved`, `external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.internal_id: {internal_id}`

→ Return to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies** for the next unresolved dependency; when all have been checked, proceed to **E. Reverse Check**.

---

## E. Reverse Check

For each other topic with a planning phase in the same work unit, read their external dependencies:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{other_topic} external_dependencies
```

#### If output is empty (no external dependencies for this topic)

Nothing to reverse-check for this topic.

→ Return to **E. Reverse Check** for the next topic.

#### Otherwise

For each dependency in the other topic's `external_dependencies`, route on state:

- **`state: unresolved` matching current topic** — find the best matching task in the current plan by name against the dependency description. Add the resolution to the working list using the task's Internal ID:

  - `{work_unit}.planning.{other_topic}` → `external_dependencies.{topic}.state: resolved`, `external_dependencies.{topic}.internal_id: {internal_id}`

- **`state: resolved` pointing at current plan's tasks** — validate that the `internal_id` still refers to a task that semantically matches the dependency description. If the task name no longer matches (stale reference), find the correct task and add the corrected pair to the working list:

  - `{work_unit}.planning.{other_topic}` → `external_dependencies.{topic}.internal_id: {corrected_internal_id}`

- **`state: satisfied_externally`** — skip.

→ Return to **E. Reverse Check** for the next topic.

When all topics have been checked, persist the working list — if it is non-empty, write one `set` op per resolution to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/dependency-ops.json` with the Write tool (fields grouped per path), then apply the batch in one atomic call:

```json
[{"op": "set", "path": "{work_unit}.planning.{topic}", "fields": {"external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.state": "resolved", "external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.internal_id": "{internal_id}"}},
 {"op": "set", "path": "{work_unit}.planning.{other_topic}", "fields": {"external_dependencies.{topic}.state": "resolved", "external_dependencies.{topic}.internal_id": "{internal_id}"}}]
```

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest apply {work_unit} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/dependency-ops.json
```

→ Proceed to **F. Summary and Commit**.

## F. Summary and Commit

#### If no changes were made (no deps to write, no reverse resolutions)

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
No external dependencies for this topic. No reverse resolutions needed.
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If changes were made

→ Proceed to **G. Present Summary**.

External Dependencies

@foreach(dep in external_dependencies)
  {dep_topic:(titlecase)} ({state})
@if(state is resolved)
  └─ {internal_id}
@endif

@endforeach
@if(reverse_resolutions)

Reverse resolutions:
@foreach(resolution in reverse_resolutions)
  {other_topic:(titlecase)} → {topic:(titlecase)}:{internal_id}
@endforeach
@endif
```

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render dependency-approval-gate {work_unit}.planning.{topic} --variant resolution
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Commit:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): resolve external dependencies" --topic planning/{topic}
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If the user provides feedback

Incorporate feedback, update the manifest entries accordingly, and commit.

→ Return to **G. Present Summary**.
