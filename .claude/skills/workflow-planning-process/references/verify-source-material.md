# Verify Source Material

*Reference for **[workflow-planning-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Verify that all source material exists and is accessible before entering agent-driven work. Agents will read these files — this step just confirms they are present.

## Verification

1. The specification is at `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`. Cross-cutting spec paths can be determined from context or the manifest.
2. For each path, run `ls` to confirm the file exists — do not read the file contents
3. If any file is missing, **STOP** — inform the user which file is missing and do not proceed

### Example

```bash
ls .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md
```
