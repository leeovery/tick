# Resolve Specification Gap

*Reference for **[workflow-planning-process](../SKILL.md)** — loaded by [define-phases.md](define-phases.md), [define-tasks.md](define-tasks.md), [author-tasks.md](author-tasks.md), and [process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md) when the concluded specification is silent, wrong, or self-contradictory on what the product does.*

---

The plan builds what the specification decided; where it decided nothing, or decided it wrong, the answer goes into the record — never into the plan. `{gap}` is what the specification asserts or omits, the evidence, and what goes wrong for the product's user if the implementer guesses; the caller also names the section or task it surfaced in. `{lane}` is the calling flow's lane — `construction` from phase design, task design, or task authoring, `review` from the findings walk — set by the caller's Load directive; its gate mode field is the one every auto check here reads: `task_list_gate_mode` or `author_gate_mode` for construction, whichever gate the caller is about to render (phase design has none), `finding_gate_mode` for review. `{work_unit}` and `{topic}` are in context from the calling session — `{topic}` names the plan and its specification alike, whose path is `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`.

`{doc}` is the source document that owns the ground a decision would land on — read the specification item's sources (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} sources`) and take the one that owns it, a single-topic unit's being the same-named document; `{source_phase}` is that source's own phase, `discussion`, or `investigation` for a bugfix.

An entry an earlier settle already landed — its corrigendum present in the specification, or its concern already queued on `{doc}`'s triage queue (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic queue {work_unit} {source_phase} {doc}` lists it) — is skipped.

The moves, by effort — and derivation is exhausted before any stop: context, the specification's own decisions, sibling artifacts, measurement against the tree. What the record yields is settled and lands silently. The one thing never derived is product intent: the plan never invents what the product does.

## A. Classify

Pick by first match:

#### If the record settles it, or a defensible derivation pins it

A measurement, a convention, a sibling decision, or another section of the specification yields the answer — or first principles over the decisions the record made whittle the fork to one answer you stand behind. The correction route verifies the ground and lands it:

→ Load **[../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md](../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** for **B. This Work Unit's Specification** with specification path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`, correcting_phase = `planning/{topic}`.

Read the verdict it returns.

**If it landed the correction** — its record-settled or derivation arm:

Tell the user in one line what landed and what determined it.

→ Return to caller.

**If the code is wrong and the specification is right:**

The tree does not yet do what the specification decides. From planning that is plan content, not a spec edit: return it to the caller as work the plan must carry — a task, or a criterion on one.

→ Return to caller.

**If it is genuinely open** — product intent, or a call the reference could not stand behind:

→ Proceed to **B. The Exchange**.

**If it returns the entry unsettled** — the specification is live in its own phase, or another session holds it:

Leave it exactly as reported: never re-classify it here, and route nothing. Tell the user in one line that the specification is out and the entry stands. The plan is held while its specification is unsettled, and a later run — the next agent return, or the review walk — re-finds the point once it settles.

→ Return to caller.

#### Otherwise

A fork in what the product does that the record does not settle.

→ Proceed to **B. The Exchange**.

## B. The Exchange

**This stop overrides `auto`.** Where `{lane}`'s gate mode holds `auto` — re-read it if it is not current in context (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} {task_list_gate_mode|author_gate_mode|finding_gate_mode}`) — open with the announcement verbatim — **Auto is on — stopping anyway:** this is one of the calls auto never makes for you. Then put the fork to the user in conversation: what the plan needs and cannot build without, what was searched and where the record ran out, the sides as product end states — what the product *is* if that side wins — what each costs the user, and your stance. No engine surface: this is an exchange, not a gate.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If the answer settles it:**

→ Proceed to **C. Land the Decision**.

**If the exchange shows it needs real discussion work** — exploration the record never did, more than a brief exchange gives:

→ Proceed to **D. Route the Gap**.

## C. Land the Decision

The decision's home is `{doc}` — the document that records decisions; the specification records none, and re-aligns to it.

Another session may hold that document. Scan presence — read the `sessions` rows only; the response's deferral section is the analysis dispatch's and is not emitted here:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs presence scan {work_unit}
```

#### If a row matches `{doc}`'s phase and topic with `held` true

The room is occupied, and a plan has one specification and nothing else to work on. The agreed resolution goes to the held session's queue and the plan waits for it.

→ Proceed to **D. Route the Gap** with the agreed resolution as the concern.

#### Otherwise

No row holds `{doc}`.

→ Load **[../../workflow-shared/references/landing-a-resolution.md](../../workflow-shared/references/landing-a-resolution.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, doc = `{doc}`, source_phase = `{source_phase}`, resolution = `{the decision the user settled, carrying what it turns on}`.

The document now carries the decision, and that decision is the record that settles the specification — the correction route classifies it record-settled, the corrigendum citing it:

→ Load **[../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md](../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** for **B. This Work Unit's Specification** with specification path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`, correcting_phase = `planning/{topic}`.

**If it landed the correction:**

Tell the user in one line what landed where — the decision in the source document, the specification brought into line.

→ Return to caller — construction re-runs its agent against the corrected record before the gate renders, and the review walk re-disposes its finding against it.

**If it returns the entry unsettled** — the specification is live in its own phase, or another session holds it:

The decision stands in the record, and the specification takes it when its own session reconciles. Flip this plan's specification extraction stale so that reconciliation happens — no `--except` here: this is the one landing whose own specification must go stale, and a single-topic work type runs it too (the skip in `landing-a-resolution.md` is about sibling specifications, which it has none of). The verb takes a discussion, so a bugfix whose `{doc}` is an investigation flips nothing — its specification is the live session already reading that document:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs sources stale {work_unit} {doc}
```

Tell the user in one line: the decision is in the record, and the specification takes it when it next runs — the plan is held until it does.

→ Return to caller — no re-run: the specification did not change.

## D. Route the Gap

The point goes to `{doc}`'s triage queue — its item reopens, the queued concern survives any context clear, and the reopened session surfaces it and cannot conclude without folding it.

#### If the work type is `epic`

→ Load **[../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, target = `{doc}`, concern = `{what the plan needs, the evidence, what was explored, and the agreed resolution where there is one}`, origin = `{topic}`, phase = `planning`, landing_phase = `discussion`, date = `{today}`.

On return, read `result` and `landed_topic`.

**If `result` is `landed`:**

The delivery committed itself, and `{landed_topic}` is the document it landed on — validation may have renamed the target.

→ Proceed to **E. Pause the Plan**.

**If `result` is `cancelled` and this section was entered from B. The Exchange:**

Nothing was written — the point stays with this session.

→ Return to **B. The Exchange**.

**If `result` is `cancelled` and this section was entered from C. Land the Decision:**

Nothing was written, and the agreed resolution reached nobody — say so in one line; the held session will not see it.

→ Return to caller.

#### Otherwise

Write the concern in the triage entry shape pinned in [triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md) — `### {short title}`, `*From: {topic} · planning · {date}*`, then what the plan needs, the evidence, what was explored, and the agreed resolution where there is one — to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/gap-concern.md` with the Write tool, then deliver it — the transaction reopens the source item, queues the concern, and commits itself:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic triage {work_unit} {source_phase} {doc} --concern .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/gap-concern.md --slug {kebab-case gap name} -m "planning({work_unit}): gap routed to {doc}"
```

Set `landed_topic` = `{doc}`.

→ Proceed to **E. Pause the Plan**.

## E. Pause the Plan

The landing moved the ground beneath the specification, and the plan is held until the specification settles against what `{landed_topic}` decides. Commit the session's work:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): pause — gap routed to {landed_topic}" --topic planning/{topic}
```

Fetch the pause gate:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render wait-gate {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
```

#### If sections are returned

Emit them verbatim per their markers — the blocker naming what is owed, its guidance, then the menu.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Paused with the gap queued — planning resumes once {landed_topic} has decided it and the specification has been brought into line.
```

Invoke `/workflow-bridge {work_unit} planning none paused`.

**If `keep`:**

Planning continues. The conclusion stays shut until the specification lands — the conclude gate meets the wait again.

→ Return to caller.

#### If the output is empty

Nothing holds the plan — the specification no longer sources `{landed_topic}`, or it is terminal. Planning continues.

→ Return to caller.
