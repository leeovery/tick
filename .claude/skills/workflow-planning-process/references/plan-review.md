# Plan Review

*Reference for **[workflow-planning-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Two-part review dispatched to sub-agents. Traceability runs first — its approved fixes are applied before the integrity review begins, so integrity evaluates the corrected plan.

---

## A. Cycle Initialization

Before opening a cycle, read `manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} tracking` — an `in-progress` entry is a prior cycle's tracking file whose findings were never fully processed — and list the `review-*-tracking-c*.md` files beside the plan: a tracking file on disk with no manifest entry is a crash orphan (the session died before recording it) — record it `in-progress`. Work each one now per **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** for that file, traceability before integrity — the order the review runs; never open a fresh cycle over live findings.

Check the `review_cycle` field in the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} review_cycle
```

#### If `review_cycle` is `0`

Set `review_cycle` to 1 in the manifest:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} review_cycle 1
```

Record the current cycle number — passed to both review agents for tracking file naming (`c{N}`).

→ Proceed to **C. Traceability Review**.

#### If `review_cycle` >= 1

Increment `review_cycle` by 1:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} review_cycle {N+1}
```

Record the current cycle number — passed to both review agents for tracking file naming (`c{N}`).

→ Proceed to **B. Cycle Gate**.

---

## B. Cycle Gate

Check `finding_gate_mode` via `engine manifest`:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} finding_gate_mode
```

#### If `review_cycle` <= 3

→ Proceed to **C. Traceability Review**.

#### If `review_cycle` > 3 and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto`

Auto mode is active — pass through to review. Section E's safety cap (cycle 5) handles escalation.

→ Proceed to **C. Traceability Review**.

#### If `review_cycle` > 3 and `finding_gate_mode` is `gated` (or not set)

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `planning-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render plan-review-gate {work_unit}.planning.{topic} --variant continue
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **C. Traceability Review**.

**If `skip`:**

→ Proceed to **F. Completion**.

---

## C. Traceability Review

→ Load **[invoke-review-traceability.md](invoke-review-traceability.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the agent has returned its result.

**If the agent created a tracking file**, record it in progress (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} tracking.{file stem} in-progress`) and commit it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): traceability review cycle {N}" --topic planning/{topic}
```

→ Load **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **D. Plan Integrity Review**.

---

## D. Plan Integrity Review

→ Load **[invoke-review-integrity.md](invoke-review-integrity.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the agent has returned its result.

**If the agent created a tracking file**, record it in progress (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} tracking.{file stem} in-progress`) and commit it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): integrity review cycle {N}" --topic planning/{topic}
```

→ Load **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **E. Re-Loop Prompt**.

---

## E. Re-Loop Prompt

Check `finding_gate_mode` and `review_cycle` via `engine manifest`:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} finding_gate_mode
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} review_cycle
```

#### If no findings were surfaced in this cycle

→ Proceed to **F. Completion**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto` and `review_cycle` < 5

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Review cycle {N} complete — findings applied. Running follow-up cycle.
```

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto` and `review_cycle` >= 5

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `planning-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Fixes applied this cycle may have shifted dependencies, introduced gaps, or affected other tasks. A follow-up round reviews the corrected plan with fresh context — 2-3 cycles typically surface anything cascading.
```

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render plan-review-gate {work_unit}.planning.{topic} --variant reloop
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **F. Completion**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `gated`

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `planning-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

> Fixes applied this cycle may have shifted dependencies, introduced gaps, or affected other tasks. A follow-up round reviews the corrected plan with fresh context — 2-3 cycles typically surface anything cascading.
```

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render plan-review-gate {work_unit}.planning.{topic} --variant reloop
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **F. Completion**.

## F. Completion

1. **Verify tracking is complete** — every `tracking` entry in the manifest, across all cycles, must be `complete`.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not confirm completion if the manifest's `tracking` subtree still holds an `in-progress` entry. It indicates incomplete review work.

Read `manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} tracking`. If any entry is `in-progress`, that file's findings were not fully processed — work them now per **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** for that tracking file, then re-verify. A tracking file on disk with no manifest entry is a crash orphan (the session died before recording it) — record it `in-progress` and process it the same way.

2. **Commit** all review tracking files:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "planning({work_unit}): complete plan review (cycle {N})" --topic planning/{topic}
   ```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Plan review complete — {N} cycle(s), all tracking files finalised.
```

→ Return to caller.
