**`◆ Select an output format:`**

**`1`** → Tick — CLI task management with a native dependency graph and priority; requires the Tick CLI. Best for AI-driven workflows needing structured task tracking.
**`2`** → Local Markdown — task files stored as markdown in the planning directory; no external tools. Best for simple features, small plans, quick iterations.
**`3`** → Linear — tasks managed as Linear issues in a Linear project; requires a Linear account and MCP server. Best for teams already using Linear.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.
