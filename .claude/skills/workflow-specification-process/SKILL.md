# Specification Process

Act as **expert technical architect** and **specification builder**. Collaborate with the user to transform source material into validated, standalone specifications.

Your role is to synthesize reference material, present it for validation, and build a specification that formal planning can execute against.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows discussion (or investigation for bugfix). Transform prior-phase source material — discussions, research notes, investigation findings — into a specification that's **standalone and approved**.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Source material** (required) - Prior-phase artifacts to synthesize (discussions, research, investigation findings)
- **Topic name** (required) - Used for the output filename

**If source material seems incomplete or unclear:**

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
I have the source material, but {concern}. Should I proceed as-is, or is there additional material I should review?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**Multiple sources:** When multiple prior-phase artifacts are provided, extract exhaustively from ALL of them. Content may be scattered across sources — a decision in one discussion may have constraints or details in another. The specification consolidates everything into a single standalone document.

---

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

---

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely, then re-load [framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md).** Do not rely on your summary of either, and re-read both even if you believe they are already loaded — that belief is what a summary feels like from the inside. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read all tracking and state files** for the current topic — the specification file, review tracking files, or any working documents this skill creates. These are your source of truth for progress.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.
5. **Check `finding_gate_mode` and `construction_gate_mode`** via `engine manifest` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} finding_gate_mode` and `... construction_gate_mode`) — if either is `auto`, the user previously opted in during this session. Preserve that value.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **STOP AND WAIT** for explicit approval before any write to the specification. Present content, wait for the user to explicitly approve (`y/yes` or equivalent), then log. No exceptions.
2. **Log verbatim** — when approved, write exactly what was presented. No silent modifications.
3. **Commit frequently** — commit at natural breaks and before any context refresh. Context refresh = lost work. Commits go through the scoped helper, action-scoped to this topic — the specification directory and the work-unit manifest, never a sibling session's files:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "{message}" --topic specification/{topic}
   ```

---

## Cancelling the Topic

The user calls the topic off — they say to cancel, or the conversation agrees it is not worth pursuing. Load **[cancelling-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/cancelling-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `specification`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Refresh the tmux session label — a no-op unless the user opted in and this session runs inside tmux:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs session label {work_unit} specification {topic}
```

Check if `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md` exists.

#### If no file exists

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If file exists

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Resume Detection`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> An in-progress specification exists for this topic — choose whether to pick it up or start fresh.
```

Load **[resume-detection.md](../workflow-shared/references/resume-detection.md)** with artifact = `specification`, file = `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`, continue_step = `Step 3`, restart_targets = `the specification file and all review tracking files (review-*-tracking-c*.md) in .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/`, restart_resets = `every sources.{name}.status and consult_references.{name}.status row under {work_unit}.specification.{topic} to pending via engine manifest set — initialization never overwrites an existing row, so without this reset the fresh file would never get its content re-extracted — and the tracking subtree and review_baseline_words deleted where present (engine manifest delete {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking, then the same for review_baseline_words — an absent field's delete errors and is skipped) to match the deleted tracking files`, commit = `spec({work_unit}): restart specification`.

→ On return, proceed as the reference directed.

---

## Step 1: Verify Source Material

Load **[verify-source-material.md](references/verify-source-material.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Initialize Specification

Load **[initialize-specification.md](references/initialize-specification.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Session Setup

Load **[session-setup.md](references/session-setup.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Load Specification Principles

Load **[specification-principles.md](references/specification-principles.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Spec Construction

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Spec Construction`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Building the specification. Topics from your source material will be extracted and presented one at a time. Nothing gets written without your explicit approval.
```

Load **[spec-construction.md](references/spec-construction.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Document Dependencies

#### If work_type is not `epic`

→ Proceed to **Step 7**.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Document Dependencies`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Recording cross-topic dependencies — for epics, specifications may depend on each other.
```

Load **[dependencies.md](references/dependencies.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 7**.

---

## Step 7: Specification Review

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Specification Review`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Reviewing the specification. Agents will measure its claims against the codebase and analyse it against source material for gaps and inconsistencies. Settled findings carry their fix; calls the record leaves open come to you as a batch to veto; genuine choices stop for your call, and any finding can be talked through — adjusted, challenged, or declined.
```

Load **[spec-review.md](references/spec-review.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 8**.

---

## Step 8: Compliance Self-Check

Load **[compliance-check.md](../workflow-shared/references/compliance-check.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 9**.

---

## Step 9: Assess Cross-Cutting & Conclude

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Conclude`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Wrapping up. Final assessment, sign-off, and @if(work_type is cross-cutting) closure — the pipeline completes here @else handover to the planning phase @endif.
```

Load **[spec-completion.md](references/spec-completion.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
