# Specification Process

Act as **expert technical architect** and **specification builder**. Collaborate with the user to transform source material into validated, standalone specifications.

Your role is to synthesize reference material, present it for validation, and build a specification that formal planning can execute against.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows discussion (or investigation for bugfix). Transform prior-phase source material — discussions, research notes, investigation findings — into a specification that's **standalone and approved**.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Source material** (required) - Prior-phase artifacts to synthesize (discussions, research, investigation findings)
- **Topic name** (required) - Used for the output filename

**If source material seems incomplete or unclear:**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
I have the source material, but {concern}. Should I proceed as-is, or is there
additional material I should review?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**Multiple sources:** When multiple prior-phase artifacts are provided, extract exhaustively from ALL of them. Content may be scattered across sources — a decision in one discussion may have constraints or details in another. The specification consolidates everything into a single standalone document.

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read all tracking and state files** for the current topic — the specification file, review tracking files, or any working documents this skill creates. These are your source of truth for progress.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.
5. **Check `finding_gate_mode`** via manifest CLI (`node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} finding_gate_mode`) — if `auto`, the user previously opted in during this session. Preserve this value.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **STOP AND WAIT** for explicit approval before any write to the specification. Present content, wait for the user to explicitly approve (`y`/`yes` or equivalent), then log. No exceptions.
2. **Log verbatim** — when approved, write exactly what was presented. No silent modifications.
3. **Commit frequently** — commit at natural breaks and before any context refresh. Context refresh = lost work.

## Output Formatting

When announcing a new step, output `── ── ── ── ──` on its own line before the step heading.

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Check if `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md` exists.

#### If no file exists

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If file exists

Read the specification status via manifest CLI (`node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} status`).

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Found existing specification for {work_unit}.
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Continue or restart?

- **`c`/`continue`** — Walk through the specification from its current state. You can review, amend, or navigate at any point.
- **`r`/`restart`** — Delete the specification and all review tracking files. Start fresh.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `continue`

→ Proceed to **Step 3** (skipping Steps 1–2).

#### If `restart`

1. Delete the specification file and all review tracking files (`review-*-tracking-c*.md`) in the specification directory (`.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/`)
2. Commit: `spec({work_unit}): restart specification`

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.
