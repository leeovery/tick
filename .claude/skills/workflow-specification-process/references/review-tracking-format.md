# Review Tracking Format

*Reference for **[spec-review](spec-review.md)***

---

Review tracking files capture analysis findings so work persists across context refresh.

## Location

Store tracking files in the specification directory (`.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/`), cycle-numbered:
- `review-claims-tracking-c{N}.md` — Phase 1 (Claims Verification) findings for cycle N
- `review-input-tracking-c{N}.md` — Phase 2 (Input Review) findings for cycle N
- `review-gap-analysis-tracking-c{N}.md` — Phase 3 (Gap Analysis) findings for cycle N

Tracking files are **never deleted** — pure markdown, no frontmatter; previous cycles' files persist as analysis history. The orchestrator records each file's gate state in the manifest (`tracking.{file stem}`: `in-progress` at dispatch, `complete` when all findings are processed).

# Review Tracking: [Topic Name] - [Phase]

## Findings

### 1. [Brief Title]

**Source**: [Where this came from — file/section reference, "Specification analysis" for Gap Analysis, or "Tree measurement — `{command}`" for Claims Verification]
**Category**: Enhancement to existing topic | New topic | Gap/Ambiguity | Contradiction | Duplication | Source defect | Unsourced decision
**Move**: settled | choice | route
**Priority**: [Gap Analysis only — Critical | Important | Minor. Omit for Claims Verification and Input Review.]
**Affects**: [Which section(s) of the specification]

**Problem**:
[What is wrong, in the terms the reader cares about — the product, the end result. Not the analysis that found it.]

**Proposal**:
[Move `settled` only — the call and what determined it, in a sentence or two. Omit for `choice` and `route`.]

**Options**:
[Move `choice` only — one line per option, "(recommended)" on at most one. Omit for `settled` and `route`.]

**Evidence**:
[Claims Verification only — the claim verbatim, the command, and its output; for a Source defect, which source document and section carries the claim. Omit for Input Review and Gap Analysis.]

**Current**:
[For findings that modify existing content (Enhancement, Duplication, Contradiction) — the existing specification content that will be modified. A Contradiction's Current holds only the passage being corrected; the colliding reading is named in the Problem with its section. Omit for New topic, Gap/Ambiguity, Source defect, and Unsourced decision findings.]

**Proposed Text**:
[The exact wording that lands in the specification — Move `settled` only. Move `route` leaves it blank permanently: the fix belongs to the source record]

**Resolution**: Pending | Approved | Adjusted | Declined | Routed
**Notes**: [Any discussion notes or adjustments made]

### 2. [Next Finding]
...
```

Some tracking files name the **Proposed Text** field **Proposed Change** or **Proposed Addition** — read all three as the same field. Older files write a `Skipped` resolution — read it as `Declined`.

`Declined` records a finding left as-is with the reason in Notes: the outcome of the gate's Discuss or Comment exchange, or a point declined at dispose — a preference no side of which costs the user, or a mechanism that is the builder's, nothing leaning, so the specification states no rule for it. It is never offered as a menu row — a decline without a stated reason is a skip whatever it is called.

## The Move

The move is what the reader has to do about the finding, and it alone decides how the finding is presented. Category describes what the reviewer found; it never picks the shape.

- **settled** — the sources or the specification's own decisions admit exactly one defensible answer. The finding carries the call and what determined it; `auto` applies it without a stop.
- **choice** — real options exist and picking between them is the reader's — a verdict earned by searching, never a default: anything the sources yield is `settled`, and a point they are silent on that a measurement or sibling artifact pins is `route`. It holds only where the fork is what the product's user gets or how it behaves, nothing in the record breaks the tie, a side visibly costs the user, and the tie-break is product intent, which only the reader holds. A fork in how the tree achieves it is the builder's, and a fork every side of which leaves the user well served is a preference, not a decision: either settles on what leans, and where nothing leans it is not the specification's to fix — the spec states no rule for it. A staged choice names what was searched and where the record ran out. The finding proposes nothing and presents the options; the stop holds even under `auto` — the search left the pick to the reader.
- **route** — the ground belongs to a source document, not this specification. It goes back to the document that owns it.

The reviewer proposes the move; the orchestrator disposes it against the live session before the finding renders, in both directions, on a derivation written into the finding — a `settled` call whose derivation does not hold, or that it cannot itself stand behind, becomes a `choice` and takes the bar; a `choice` below the bar becomes `settled` or `route`, or is declined outright — Resolution `Declined`, the Move left as staged — its derivation recorded (**[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)**). A choice that names no search is re-derived from scratch.

Two categories always take the `route` move, and their findings are never applied, adjusted, or presented at the gate — the orchestrator routes them per [resolve-source-incoherence.md](resolve-source-incoherence.md), and the resolution lands as `Routed`:

- **Source defect** — the specification faithfully carries a source claim or decision that is itself wrong: it fails direct measurement against the tree, or rests on ground the record has since superseded.
- **Unsourced decision** — the specification states a requirement or design decision that no source makes. The spec makes decisions clear; it never makes them.

## Workflow with Tracking Files

1. Complete your analysis and create the tracking file with all findings
2. Commit the tracking file — ensures it survives context refresh
3. Present the summary to the user (from the tracking file)
4. Work through items one at a time:
   - A `route` finding routes per **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** — Resolution `Routed`, never presented at the gate
   - A finding the dispose declines — Resolution `Declined` with its reason, never presented at the gate
   - Every other item: present it by its move, discuss and refine, get approval, log to specification
   - Update the tracking file: mark resolution, add notes
5. After all items resolved, record the flip: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking.{file stem} complete`

**Why tracking files**: If context refreshes mid-review, you can read the tracking file and continue where you left off. The tracking file shows which items are resolved and which remain. This is especially important when reviews surface 10-20 items that need individual discussion.
