# Specification Review

*Reference for **[workflow-specification-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Three-phase review of the specification. Phase 1 (Claims Verification) measures the specification's empirical claims against the working tree. Phase 2 (Input Review) compares against source material. Phase 3 (Gap Analysis) reviews the specification as a standalone document.

**CRITICAL**: Phases are strictly sequential — never dispatch two agents in parallel. Claims run first because a false claim carried faithfully from a source reads to fidelity review as a perfect match — its routing must land before Phase 2 compares; Phase 2 findings are applied before Phase 3 reviews the updated document.

**Why this matters**: The specification is the golden document — the record of what was decided, from which the plan and then the code are built. A decision it drops never reaches the plan; a rule it adds that nobody made is a decision the record never took. The review holds both lines: every decision the sources made is on the page, and nothing on the page decides what they left open — that remainder is the planner's.

→ Load **[review-tracking-format.md](review-tracking-format.md)** — internalize the tracking file format for all three phases.

---

## A. Cycle Initialization

Before opening a cycle, read `manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking` — an `in-progress` entry is a prior cycle's tracking file whose findings were never fully processed — and list the `review-*-tracking-c*.md` files beside the specification: a tracking file on disk with no manifest entry is a crash orphan (the session died before recording it) — record it `in-progress`. Work each one now per **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** for that file, claims before input before gap analysis — the order the cycle runs; never open a fresh cycle over live findings.

Check the `review_cycle` field via `engine manifest` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} review_cycle`).

#### If `review_cycle` is 0 or not set

Set `review_cycle` to 1 and record the construction baseline — the word count review growth is measured against at every escalation:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} review_cycle=1 review_baseline_words=$(wc -w < .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md)
```

Record the current cycle number — used for tracking file naming (`c{N}`).

Commit the updated manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): begin review cycle {N}" --topic specification/{topic}
```

→ Proceed to **C. Phase 1 — Claims Verification**.

#### If `review_cycle` is already set

Increment `review_cycle` by 1 via `engine manifest` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} review_cycle {N+1}`).

Record the current cycle number — used for tracking file naming (`c{N}`).

Commit the updated manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): begin review cycle {N}" --topic specification/{topic}
```

→ Proceed to **B. Cycle Gate**.

---

## B. Cycle Gate

Check `finding_gate_mode` via `engine manifest` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} finding_gate_mode`).

#### If `review_cycle` <= 3

→ Proceed to **C. Phase 1 — Claims Verification**.

#### If `review_cycle` > 3 and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto`

Auto mode is active — pass through to review. Section F stops the loop on a churning verdict from cycle 2; the cycle-5 cap is its backstop.

→ Proceed to **C. Phase 1 — Claims Verification**.

#### If `review_cycle` > 3 and `finding_gate_mode` is `gated` (or not set)

**Do NOT skip review autonomously.** This gate is an escape hatch for the user — not a signal to stop. The expected default is to continue running review until no product-level gap remains. Present the choice and let the user decide.

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `spec-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, render_when = `always`.

Fetch the gate and emit its section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-review-gate {work_unit}.specification.{topic} --variant continue
```

You MUST NOT choose on the user's behalf.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **C. Phase 1 — Claims Verification**.

**If `skip`:**

→ Proceed to **G. Completion**.

---

## C. Phase 1 — Claims Verification

Dispatch the `workflow-specification-review-claims` agent via the Task tool:

- **Agent file**: `../../../agents/workflow-specification-review-claims.md`
- **Work unit**: the current work unit
- **Specification path**: the specification file path
- **Source material paths**: resolve source names to file paths. Read source names and work type from the manifest:
  ```bash
  node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} sources
  node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit} work_type
  ```
  Sources returns an object keyed by source name (e.g., `{"auth-design": {"status": "incorporated"}}`). Resolve each source name to its artifact — sources can be incorporated specifications or research files, not only discussions. First match wins:

  1. `{source-name}` is not `{topic}` and a specification item named `{source-name}` exists in the manifest (an incorporated source spec) → `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{source-name}/specification.md`
  2. `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{source-name}.md` exists → that research file
  3. Work type is `bugfix` → `.workflows/{work_unit}/investigation/{source-name}.md`
  4. Otherwise → `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{source-name}.md`

  Pass all resolved paths to the agent.
- **Topic name**: the current topic
- **Cycle number**: the current cycle number
- **Review tracking format path**: `review-tracking-format.md` (in this references directory)

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the agent has returned its result.

Hold its STATUS as `phase_1_status` — carried in context for the branch below, never a manifest write.

**If the agent created a tracking file**, record it in progress (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking.{file stem} in-progress`) and commit it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): claims verification cycle {N}" --topic specification/{topic}
```

→ Load **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **D. Phase 2 — Input Review**.

---

## D. Phase 2 — Input Review

Dispatch the `workflow-specification-review-input` agent via the Task tool:

- **Agent file**: `../../../agents/workflow-specification-review-input.md`
- **Work unit**: the current work unit
- **Specification path**: the specification file path
- **Source material paths**: the paths resolved in **C** — re-resolve via the ladder there when they are no longer in context
- **Topic name**: the current topic
- **Cycle number**: the current cycle number
- **Review tracking format path**: `review-tracking-format.md` (in this references directory)

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the agent has returned its result.

Hold its STATUS as `phase_2_status` — carried in context for the branch below, never a manifest write.

**If the agent created a tracking file**, record it in progress (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking.{file stem} in-progress`) and commit it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): input review cycle {N}" --topic specification/{topic}
```

→ Load **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **E. Phase 3 — Gap Analysis**.

---

## E. Phase 3 — Gap Analysis

List the earlier cycles' gap-analysis tracking files beside the specification — every `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/review-gap-analysis-tracking-c{M}.md` whose `{M}` is below the current cycle. Cycle 1 lists none.

Dispatch the `workflow-specification-review-gap-analysis` agent via the Task tool:

- **Agent file**: `../../../agents/workflow-specification-review-gap-analysis.md`
- **Work unit**: the current work unit
- **Specification path**: the specification file path
- **Topic name**: the current topic
- **Cycle number**: the current cycle number
- **Review tracking format path**: `review-tracking-format.md` (in this references directory)
- **Earlier cycles' gap-analysis tracking files**: the paths listed above — the settled directions a finding may not reverse. None at cycle 1.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the agent has returned its result.

Hold its STATUS as `phase_3_status` — carried in context for the branch below, never a manifest write.

**If the agent created a tracking file**, record it in progress (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking.{file stem} in-progress`) and commit it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): gap analysis cycle {N}" --topic specification/{topic}
```

→ Load **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **F. Re-Loop Prompt**.

---

## F. Re-Loop Prompt

Check `finding_gate_mode` and `review_cycle` via `engine manifest`:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} finding_gate_mode
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} review_cycle
```

#### If `phase_1_status`, `phase_2_status`, and `phase_3_status` are all `clean`

→ Proceed to **G. Completion**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto` and `review_cycle` < 5

From the second cycle onward the trend decides whether `auto` keeps looping: a churning loop hands the call to the user.

**If `review_cycle` is 2, 3, or 4:**

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `spec-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, render_when = `churning`.

**If `review_cycle` is 1, or the analysis classified no `churning` trend:**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Review cycle {N} complete — findings applied. Running follow-up cycle.
```

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `review_cycle` is 2, 3, or 4 and the analysis classified the trend as `churning`** (its diagnostic rendered above):

Fetch the gate and emit its section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-review-gate {work_unit}.specification.{topic} --variant reloop
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **G. Completion**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `auto` and `review_cycle` >= 5

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `spec-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, render_when = `always`.

Fetch the gate and emit its section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-review-gate {work_unit}.specification.{topic} --variant reloop
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **G. Completion**.

#### If findings were surfaced and `finding_gate_mode` is `gated`

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `spec-review`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, render_when = `always`.

Fetch the gate and emit its section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-review-gate {work_unit}.specification.{topic} --variant reloop
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to **A. Cycle Initialization**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **G. Completion**.

---

## G. Completion

1. **Verify tracking is complete** — read `manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} tracking`; every entry across all cycles must be `complete`.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not confirm completion if the manifest's `tracking` subtree still holds an `in-progress` entry. It indicates incomplete review work.

If any entry is `in-progress`, that file's findings were not fully processed — work them now per **[process-review-findings.md](process-review-findings.md)** for that tracking file, then re-verify. A tracking file on disk with no manifest entry is a crash orphan (the session died before recording it) — record it `in-progress` and process it the same way.

2. **Commit** all review tracking files:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "spec({work_unit}): complete specification review (cycle {N})" --topic specification/{topic}
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Specification review complete — {N} cycle(s), all tracking files finalised.
```

→ Return to caller.
