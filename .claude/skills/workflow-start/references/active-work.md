Workflow Overview

@if(feature_count > 0)
Features:
@foreach(unit in features.work_units)
  {N}. {unit.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ {unit.phase_label:(titlecase)}

@endforeach
@endif

@if(bugfix_count > 0)
Bugfixes:
@foreach(unit in bugfixes.work_units)
  {N}. {unit.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ {unit.phase_label:(titlecase)}

@endforeach
@endif

@if(epic_count > 0)
Epics:
@foreach(unit in epics.work_units)
  {N}. {unit.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ {unit.active_phases:(titlecase, comma-separated)}

@endforeach
@endif

@if(completed_count > 0 || cancelled_count > 0)
{completed_count} completed, {cancelled_count} cancelled.
@endif
```

Build from discovery output. Only show sections that have work units. Numbering is continuous across sections. Feature/bugfix shows `phase_label` (titlecased). Epic shows comma-separated `active_phases` (titlecased). Blank line between each numbered item.

## Menu

Build a numbered menu with continue items first, then start-new options, then lifecycle options, separated by blank lines.

What would you like to do?

1. Continue "{feature.name:(titlecase)}" — feature, {feature.phase_label}
2. Continue "{bugfix.name:(titlecase)}" — bugfix, {bugfix.phase_label}
3. Continue "{epic.name:(titlecase)}" — epic

4. Start new feature
5. Start new epic
6. Start new bugfix

@if(completed_count > 0 || cancelled_count > 0)
7. View completed & cancelled work units
@endif
- **`m`/`manage`** — Manage a work unit's lifecycle

Select an option (enter number):
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**Continue items:** Feature/bugfix shows type + phase label. Epic just shows "epic" (detail is in continue-epic). No auto-select — always show the full menu. No "(recommended)" labels.

**Start-new items:** Always show all three start options.

Recreate with actual work units from discovery.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose a continue or start-new option

Invoke the selected skill:

| Selection | Invoke |
|-----------|--------|
| Continue feature | `/continue-feature {work_unit}` |
| Continue bugfix | `/continue-bugfix {work_unit}` |
| Continue epic | `/continue-epic {work_unit}` |
| Start new feature | `/start-feature` |
| Start new epic | `/start-epic` |
| Start new bugfix | `/start-bugfix` |

This skill ends. The invoked skill will load into context and provide additional instructions. Terminal.

#### If user chose "View completed & cancelled"

→ Load **[view-completed.md](view-completed.md)** with no work_type filter (unified across all types). On return, re-run discovery and redisplay from the top of this reference.

#### If user chose `m`/`manage`

→ Load **[manage-work-unit.md](manage-work-unit.md)**. On return, re-run discovery and redisplay from the top of this reference.
