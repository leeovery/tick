Build from the completed and cancelled sections in the discovery output. Numbering is continuous across both sections. Blank line between each numbered item.

→ Proceed to **B. Select**.

## B. Select

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Select a work unit for details, or **`b`/`back`** to return.

Select an option (enter number):
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose `b`/`back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose a number

Store the selected item.

→ Proceed to **C. Action Menu**.

## C. Action Menu

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**{selected.name:(titlecase)}** ({selected.status})

- **`r`/`reactivate`** — Set status back to in-progress
- **`b`/`back`** — Return to the list
- **Ask** — Ask a question about this work unit
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose `r`/`reactivate`

Set status back to in-progress:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {selected.name} status in-progress
```

Capture whether `completed_at` is set (used by the completed branches; harmless on the cancelled path):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {selected.name} completed_at
```

**If `selected.status` was `cancelled`:**

Cancellation removed the work unit's chunks from the knowledge base. Restore them by loading **[reindex-work-unit.md](../../workflow-knowledge/references/reindex-work-unit.md)** with work_unit = `{selected.name}`.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
"{selected.name:(titlecase)}" reactivated.
```

→ Return to caller.

**If `selected.status` was `completed` and `completed_at` is set:**

Completed work units retain their chunks — no re-indexing needed. Clear the stale `completed_at`:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs delete {selected.name} completed_at
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
"{selected.name:(titlecase)}" reactivated.
```

→ Return to caller.

**If `selected.status` was `completed` and `completed_at` is not set:**

Completed work units retain their chunks — no re-indexing needed.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
"{selected.name:(titlecase)}" reactivated.
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `b`/`back`

→ Return to **A. Display List**.

#### If user asked a question

Answer the question.

→ Return to **C. Action Menu**.
