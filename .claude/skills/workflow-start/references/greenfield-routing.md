# Greenfield Routing

*Reference for **[workflow-start](../SKILL.md)***

---

Greenfield development is phase-centric. All artifacts in a phase complete before moving to the next. This reference shows what's actionable in each phase and offers options to continue existing work or start new.

## Display Greenfield State

Using the discovery output, build the phase-centric view.

Greenfield Overview

Research:
@if(research_count > 0)
  @foreach(file in research.files)
  └─ {file}
  @endforeach
@else
  (none)
@endif

Discussions:
@if(greenfield.discussions.count > 0)
  @foreach(disc in greenfield.discussions.files)
  └─ {disc.name:(titlecase)} ({disc.status})
  @endforeach
@else
  (none)
@endif

Specifications:
@if(greenfield.specifications.count > 0)
  @foreach(spec in greenfield.specifications.files)
  └─ {spec.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ Spec: {spec.status} ({spec.type})
  @endforeach
@else
  (none)
@endif

Plans:
@if(greenfield.plans.count > 0)
  @foreach(plan in greenfield.plans.files)
  └─ {plan.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ Plan: {plan.status}
  @endforeach
@else
  (none)
@endif

Implementation:
@if(greenfield.implementation.count > 0)
  @foreach(impl in greenfield.implementation.files)
  └─ {impl.topic:(titlecase)}
     └─ Implementation: {impl.status}
  @endforeach

## Build Menu Options

Build a numbered menu of actionable items. The verb depends on the state:

| State | Verb |
|-------|------|
| In-progress discussion | Continue |
| In-progress specification | Continue |
| Concluded spec (feature), no plan | Start planning for |
| In-progress plan | Continue |
| Concluded plan, no implementation | Start implementation of |
| In-progress implementation | Continue |
| Completed implementation, no review | Start review for |
| Research exists | Continue research |
| No discussions yet | Start research / Start new discussion |

**Specification phase is different in greenfield**: Don't offer "Start specification from {topic}". Instead, when concluded discussions exist, offer "Start specification" which invokes `/start-specification`. The specification skill will analyze ALL concluded discussions and suggest groupings — multiple discussions may become one spec, or split differently.

**Specification readiness:**
- All discussions concluded → "Start specification" (recommended)
- Some discussions still in-progress → "Start specification" with note: "(some discussions still in-progress)"

Always include "Start new discussion" as a final option.

What would you like to do?

1. Continue "Auth Flow" discussion — in-progress
2. Continue "Data Model" specification — in-progress
3. Start planning for "User Profiles" — spec concluded
4. Continue "Caching" plan — in-progress
5. Start implementation of "Notifications" — plan concluded
6. Start specification — 3 discussions concluded (recommended)
7. Continue research
8. Start new discussion

Select an option (enter number):

```

Recreate with actual topics and states from discovery. Only include options that apply based on current state.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

## Route Based on Selection

Parse the user's selection, then follow the instructions below the table to invoke the appropriate skill.

| Selection | Skill | Work Type | Topic |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Continue discussion | `/start-discussion` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Continue specification | `/start-specification` | greenfield | — |
| Continue plan | `/start-planning` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Continue implementation | `/start-implementation` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Continue research | `/start-research` | greenfield | — |
| Start specification | `/start-specification` | greenfield | — |
| Start planning | `/start-planning` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Start implementation | `/start-implementation` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Start review | `/start-review` | greenfield | {topic} |
| Start research | `/start-research` | greenfield | — |
| Start new discussion | `/start-discussion` | greenfield | — |

Skills receive positional arguments: `$0` = work_type, `$1` = topic.

**With arguments** (bridge mode): `/start-discussion greenfield {topic}` — skill skips discovery, validates topic, proceeds to processing.

**Without arguments** (discovery mode): `/start-discussion greenfield` — skill runs discovery with work_type context.

**Note on specification**: Unlike feature/bugfix pipelines, greenfield specification is NOT topic-centric. Don't pass a topic. Always route through discovery mode so analysis can detect changed discussions.

Invoke the skill from the table with the topic and work type as positional arguments. If no topic or work type is shown, invoke the skill bare.
