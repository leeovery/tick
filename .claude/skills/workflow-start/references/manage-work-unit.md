# Manage Work Unit

*Reference for **[workflow-start](../SKILL.md)***

---

Manage an in-progress work unit's lifecycle.

## A. Select

Render the manage selection snapshot:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-start/scripts/gateway.cjs manage
```

The output is one snapshot in three demarcated sections:

- **DATA** — reasoning surface: `unit_count`, the project `baseline` status, and the `UNITS` table — one line per work unit, `n  work_type  work_unit`, numbering matching the overview. Reason from it; never display or restate it.
- **TITLE** — the view's chrome heading. Emit verbatim per its marker, directly above the menu.
- **MENU** — the work units as a numbered pick list, then the baseline and back rows. Emit verbatim per its marker.

Emit the TITLE section, then the MENU section, each verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose `b/back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `a/baseline`

Invoke `/workflow-baseline` — it reads the baseline status and routes itself.

This skill ends. The invoked skill will load into context and provide additional instructions. Terminal.

#### If user chose a number

Store the selected work unit's `UNITS` row — its name and work type.

→ Proceed to **B. Action Menu**.

## B. Action Menu

Render the selected work unit's manage snapshot:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-start/scripts/gateway.cjs manage {selected.name}
```

The response carries demarcated sections:

- **DATA** — reasoning surface: lifecycle flags (`implementation_completed`, `has_plan`, `absorb_available`, …), `available_epics`, `planning_topics`, and the `ACTIONS` key table. Reason from it; never display or restate it.
- **MENU** — the action menu, offering exactly the actions this work unit's state allows. Emit verbatim per its marker at this section's gate below.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Lifecycle actions for this work unit. Done marks it finished, cancel abandons it, pivot converts a feature to an epic when the scope grows beyond a single topic, absorb merges a feature's discussion into an existing epic.
```

Emit the MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

A branch below can only be chosen when the menu offered its option.

#### If user chose `d/done`

Run the complete transaction — one command sets `status: completed`, stamps `completed_at`, and commits:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs workunit complete {selected.name} -m "workflow({selected.name}): mark as completed"
```

Fetch and emit the receipt's `DISPLAY: confirmation` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render workunit-receipt {selected.name} --verb complete
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `p/pivot`

→ Load **[pivot-to-epic.md](../../workflow-shared/references/pivot-to-epic.md)** with work_unit = `{selected.name}`.

On return, fetch and emit the `MENU: pivot continuation` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render pivot-continuation {selected.name}
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If user chose `c/continue`:**

Invoke the `/workflow-continue-epic` skill.

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

**If user chose `b/back`:**

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `a/absorb`

→ Load **[absorb-into-epic.md](absorb-into-epic.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `v/view-plan`

→ Load **[view-plan.md](view-plan.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Action Menu**.

#### If user chose `c/cancel`

Run the cancel transaction — one command sets `status: cancelled`, removes the work unit's chunks from the knowledge base, and commits:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs workunit cancel {selected.name}
```

Fetch and emit the receipt — the `DISPLAY: kb warning` advisory (when carried) then the `DISPLAY: confirmation` section, each verbatim per its marker — adding `--warn` when the response's `warnings` is non-empty:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render workunit-receipt {selected.name} --verb cancel [--warn]
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `b/back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user asked a question

Answer the question. The question sets the gate aside until the person is ready to move on; to put it back:

→ Return to **B. Action Menu**.
