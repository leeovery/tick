# Knowledge Gate

*Reference for **[workflow-start](../SKILL.md)***

---

The knowledge base is required infrastructure — no workflow proceeds without it. Initialise it here, conversationally. The API key is the one thing that must NEVER pass through this chat: every path below keeps it in the user's terminal or shell environment, and you never ask for it, accept it, or echo it.
If a key appears in the conversation anyway, do not repeat, quote, or store any part of it — acknowledge without echoing, note that a key pasted into chat should be treated as exposed and rotated, and direct entry through `knowledge setup --key-only`.

Read the boot response's `system_config` object: `status` (`valid`, `absent`, or `invalid`), `provider`, and `model`.

## A. Route

#### If `system_config.status` is `valid`

→ Proceed to **B. Use Existing Configuration**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **C. Choose a Mode**.

## B. Use Existing Configuration

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> The knowledge base powers recall across work units and within them — later phases draw on earlier work. It is required infrastructure: no workflow runs until it is initialised. Your machine already has a system configuration this project can reuse.
```

Fetch the gate and emit its `MENU: knowledge reuse gate` section verbatim per its marker. When `system_config` names a provider, pass it — and its model when one is named:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant reuse --provider {system_config.provider} --model {system_config.model}
```

When it names no provider (keyword-only), pass neither:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant reuse
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Run:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --from-system
```

→ Proceed to **G. Handle Setup Result** with origin = `B`.

#### If `different`

A per-project deviation never touches the system-wide configuration. Keyword-only is the per-project mode; a different *provider* is a system-wide decision — the wizard's job.

Fetch the gate and emit its `MENU: knowledge deviate gate` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant deviate
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `keyword`:**

→ Proceed to **C. Choose a Mode** for the `keyword` branch.

**If `terminal`:**

→ Proceed to **F. Terminal Wizard**.

#### If `terminal`

→ Proceed to **F. Terminal Wizard**.

## C. Choose a Mode

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Pick how this project's knowledge base should search. OpenAI needs an API key — stored in your terminal, never pasted here. Keyword-only needs no key and can be upgraded anytime.
```

Fetch the gate and emit its `MENU: knowledge mode gate` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant mode
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `openai`

> *Output the next fenced block as a text code block (```text fence):*

```text
Which OpenAI embedding model?

- Reply with a model name, or "default" for text-embedding-3-small.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Run with the chosen model (`text-embedding-3-small` for "default"):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --provider openai --model {model}
```

→ Proceed to **G. Handle Setup Result** with origin = `C-openai`.

#### If `compatible`

> *Output the next fenced block as a text code block (```text fence):*

```text
Where is the embeddings endpoint?

- Base URL (e.g. http://localhost:1234/v1)
- Model name
- Vector dimensions — must match the model's native output
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Run with the collected values:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --provider openai-compatible --base-url {base_url} --model {model} --dimensions {dimensions}
```

Keyless endpoints are fine — a key stored in the credentials file is picked up automatically.

→ Proceed to **G. Handle Setup Result** with origin = `C-compatible`.

#### If `keyword`

Run:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --keyword-only
```

→ Proceed to **G. Handle Setup Result** with origin = `keyword`.

#### If `terminal`

→ Proceed to **F. Terminal Wizard**.

## D. Store the API Key

The setup command refused or was rejected because no working API key is available for the provider it targeted. The key goes straight from the user's terminal into a private store — it never touches this chat.

> *Output the next fenced block as a text code block (```text fence):*

```text
@if(provider is openai)
No OpenAI API key was found. Store one without it touching this
chat — run ONE of these in your terminal, then come back:

  node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --key-only
      Private prompt, input hidden. Stored at
      ~/.config/workflows/credentials.json (mode 0600).

  export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>   # note: inline export lands in shell history — --key-only avoids that
      Shell environment — takes precedence over the stored key.
@else
The endpoint requires an API key. Store one without it touching
this chat — run this in your terminal, then come back:

  node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --key-only --provider openai-compatible
      Private prompt, input hidden. Stored at
      ~/.config/workflows/credentials.json (mode 0600).
@endif
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Do not paste the API key into this chat — not even partially. Store it in your terminal with one of the commands above, then come back here.
```

Fetch the gate and emit its `MENU: knowledge retry gate` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant retry
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Re-run the setup command whose key failure routed here — `origin` names it — skipping the originating branch's menus and questions; its values are already collected. The re-run lands back at **G** to handle the fresh result.

**If `origin` is `B`:**

→ Return to **B. Use Existing Configuration** for the `yes` branch's setup command.

**If `origin` is `C-openai`:**

→ Return to **C. Choose a Mode** for the `openai` branch's setup command.

**If `origin` is `C-compatible`:**

→ Return to **C. Choose a Mode** for the `compatible` branch's setup command.

#### If `keyword`

Run:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --keyword-only
```

→ Proceed to **G. Handle Setup Result** with origin = `keyword`.

## E. Confirm and Continue

Fetch the confirmation — it names the configuration this checkout's store was built with — and emit its `DISPLAY: knowledge ready` section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-ready
```

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 0.6**.

## F. Terminal Wizard

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`▪ Knowledge Base Setup`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> The interactive wizard runs in your terminal. It walks provider choice, key entry (input hidden), and project store setup.
```

Fetch the gate and emit its `DISPLAY: knowledge wizard` and `MENU: knowledge wizard gate` sections verbatim per their markers:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render knowledge-gate --variant wizard
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Re-run the boot check:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs boot
```

**If `knowledge` is `ready`:**

If the response carries `warnings`, surface them.

→ Return to **E. Confirm and Continue**.

**If `knowledge` is still `not-ready`:**

The wizard did not complete. Surface the boot response's detail.

→ Return to **A. Route**.

## G. Handle Setup Result

The setup command just ran. Branch on its result. `origin` names the branch that ran it — the authentication path routes back through **D** to that origin's command.

#### If the command succeeded

When its output reports artifacts that failed to index (`N artifact(s) failed to index`) or an initial indexing error, surface it in one sentence — the next start retries them.

→ Return to **E. Confirm and Continue**.

#### If the command failed with an authentication error (HTTP 401/403), or — for an openai provider — with "no OpenAI API key found"

The stored key is missing, revoked, or wrong for this endpoint. Keyword-only origins never reach here: `--keyword-only` performs no authentication, so its only failure is the "any other reason" path below.

→ Return to **D. Store the API Key** with origin = `{origin}`.

#### If the command failed for any other reason

Surface the reported error verbatim. The knowledge base could not be initialised — the workflow cannot proceed.

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.
