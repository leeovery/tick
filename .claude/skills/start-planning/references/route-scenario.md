Discovery mode — use the discovery output from Step 1.

Use `state.scenario` from the discovery output to determine the path:

No specifications exist yet.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Planning Overview

No specifications found in .workflows/specification/

The planning phase requires a concluded specification.
Run /start-specification first.
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

#### If scenario is "nothing_actionable"

Specifications exist but none are actionable — all are still in-progress and no plans exist to continue.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.

#### If scenario is "has_options"

At least one specification is ready for planning, or an existing plan can be continued or reviewed.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.
