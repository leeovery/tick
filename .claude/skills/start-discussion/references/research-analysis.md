# Research Analysis

*Reference for **[start-discussion](../SKILL.md)***

---

This step only runs when research files exist.

Use `cache.status` from discovery to determine the approach:

#### If cache.status is "valid"

```
Using cached research analysis (unchanged since {cache.generated})
```

Load the topics from `docs/workflow/.state/research-analysis.md` and proceed.

#### If cache.status is "stale" or "none"

```
Analyzing research documents...
```

Read each research file and extract key themes and potential discussion topics. For each theme:
- Note the source file and relevant line numbers
- Summarize what the theme is about in 1-2 sentences
- Identify key questions or decisions that need discussion

**Be thorough**: This analysis will be cached, so identify ALL potential topics:
- Major architectural decisions
- Technical trade-offs mentioned
- Open questions or concerns raised
- Implementation approaches discussed
- Integration points with external systems
- Security or performance considerations
- Edge cases or error handling mentioned

**Save to cache:**

Ensure the cache directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/workflow/.state
```

Create/update `docs/workflow/.state/research-analysis.md`:

## Topics

### {Theme name}
- **Source**: {filename}.md (lines {start}-{end})
- **Summary**: {1-2 sentence summary}
- **Key questions**: {what needs deciding}

### {Another theme}
- **Source**: {filename}.md (lines {start}-{end})
- **Summary**: {1-2 sentence summary}
- **Key questions**: {what needs deciding}
```

**Cross-reference**: For each topic, note if a discussion already exists (from `discussions.files` in discovery).
