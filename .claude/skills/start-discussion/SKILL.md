Invoke the **technical-discussion** skill for this conversation.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Workflow Context

This is **Phase 2** of the six-phase workflow:

| Phase              | Focus                                              | You    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1. Research        | EXPLORE - ideas, feasibility, market, business     |        |
| **2. Discussion**  | WHAT and WHY - decisions, architecture, edge cases | ◀ HERE |
| 3. Specification   | REFINE - validate into standalone spec             |        |
| 4. Planning        | HOW - phases, tasks, acceptance criteria           |        |
| 5. Implementation  | DOING - tests first, then code                     |        |
| 6. Review          | VALIDATING - check work against artifacts          |        |

**Stay in your lane**: Capture the WHAT and WHY - decisions, rationale, competing approaches, edge cases. Don't jump to specifications, plans, or code. This is the time for debate and documentation.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them. Present output using the EXACT format shown in examples - do not simplify or alter the formatting.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Even if the user's initial prompt seems to answer a question, still confirm with them at the appropriate step
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Do not act on gathered information until the skill is loaded - it contains the instructions for how to proceed

---

## Step 0: Run Migrations

**This step is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Invoke the `/migrate` skill and assess its output.

**If files were updated**: STOP and wait for the user to review the changes (e.g., via `git diff`) and confirm before proceeding to Step 1. Do not continue automatically.

**If no updates needed**: Proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Discovery State

!`.claude/skills/start-discussion/scripts/discovery.sh`

If the above shows a script invocation rather than YAML output, the dynamic content preprocessor did not run. Execute the script before continuing:

```bash
.claude/skills/start-discussion/scripts/discovery.sh
```

If YAML content is already displayed, it has been run on your behalf.

Parse the discovery output to understand:

**From `research` section:**
- `exists` - whether research files exist
- `files` - each research file's name and topic
- `checksum` - current checksum of all research files

**From `discussions` section:**
- `exists` - whether discussion files exist
- `files` - each discussion's name, status, and date
- `counts.in_progress` and `counts.concluded` - totals for routing

**From `cache` section:**
- `status` - one of three values:
  - `"valid"` - cache exists and checksums match (safe to load)
  - `"stale"` - cache exists but research has changed (needs re-analysis)
  - `"none"` - no cache file exists
- `reason` - explanation of the status
- `generated` - when the cache was created (null if none)
- `research_files` - list of files that were analyzed

**From `state` section:**
- `scenario` - one of: `"fresh"`, `"research_only"`, `"discussions_only"`, `"research_and_discussions"`

**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY this script for discovery. Do NOT run additional bash commands (ls, head, cat, etc.) to gather state - the script provides everything needed.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Route Based on Scenario

Use `state.scenario` from the discovery output to determine the path:

#### If scenario is "research_only" or "research_and_discussions"

Research exists and may need analysis.

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

#### If scenario is "discussions_only"

No research exists, but discussions do. Skip research analysis.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

#### If scenario is "fresh"

No research or discussions exist yet.

```
Starting fresh - no prior research or discussions found.

What topic would you like to discuss?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

When user responds, proceed with their topic.

→ Proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 3: Research Analysis

Load **[research-analysis.md](references/research-analysis.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Present Options

Load **[display-options.md](references/display-options.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Handle Selection

Load **[handle-selection.md](references/handle-selection.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Gather Context

Load **[gather-context.md](references/gather-context.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 7**.

---

## Step 7: Invoke the Skill

Before invoking the processing skill, save a session bookmark.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Saving session state so Claude can pick up where it left off if the conversation is compacted.
```

```bash
.claude/hooks/workflows/write-session-state.sh \
  "{topic}" \
  "skills/technical-discussion/SKILL.md" \
  "docs/workflow/discussion/{topic}.md"
```

Load **[invoke-skill.md](references/invoke-skill.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
