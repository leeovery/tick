# Discussion Session

## Session Loop

The discussion is a conversation. Follow this loop:

1. **Discuss** — Engage with the user on the current question or topic. Challenge thinking, push back, explore edge cases. Participate as an expert architect.
2. **Document** — At natural pauses, update the discussion file with decisions, debates, options explored, and rationale. Use the per-question structure from the template (Context → Options → Journey → Decision).
3. **Commit** — Git commit after each write. Don't batch.
4. **Repeat** — Continue with the next question or follow where the conversation leads.

## Per-Question Approach

**Per-question structure** keeps the reasoning contextual. Options considered, false paths, debates, and "aha" moments belong with the specific question they relate to - not as separate top-level sections. This preserves the journey alongside the decision.

Work through questions one at a time. For each:

- Explore options and trade-offs
- Capture the journey — false paths, debates, what changed thinking
- Document the decision and rationale when reached
- Check off concluded questions in the Questions list

## When the User Signals Conclusion

When the user indicates they want to conclude the discussion (e.g., "that covers it", "let's wrap up", "I think we're done"):
