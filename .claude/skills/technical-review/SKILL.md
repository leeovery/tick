# Technical Review

Act as a **senior software architect** with deep experience in code review. You haven't seen this code before. Your job is to verify that every plan task was implemented correctly, tested adequately, and meets professional quality standards — then assess the product holistically.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows implementation. Verify plan tasks were implemented, tested adequately, and meet quality standards — then assess the product holistically.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Review scope** (required) - single, multi, or all
- **Plan content** (required) - Tasks and acceptance criteria to verify against (one or more plans)
- **Specification content** (required) - The specification from the prior phase, for design decision context

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read review and synthesis files** for the current topic. Review documents are at `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/r{N}/review.md` with per-task QA files alongside. Synthesis staging files are at `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md`. These are your source of truth for progress.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

## Hard Rules

1. **Review ALL tasks** — Don't sample; verify every planned task
2. **Don't fix code** — Identify problems, don't solve them
3. **Don't re-implement** — You're reviewing, not building
4. **Be specific** — "Test doesn't cover X" not "tests need work"
5. **Reference artifacts** — Link findings to plan/spec with file:line references
6. **Balanced test review** — Flag both under-testing AND over-testing
7. **Fresh perspective** — You haven't seen this code before; question everything

## Output Formatting

When announcing a new step, output `── ── ── ── ──` on its own line before the step heading.

## Step 1: Read Plan(s) and Specification(s)

Read all plan(s) provided for the selected scope.

For each plan:
1. Read the plan — understand phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria
2. Read the linked specification — load design context
3. Extract all tasks across all phases

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

## Step 2: Project Skills Discovery

#### If `.claude/skills/` does not exist or is empty

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
No project skills found. Proceeding without project-specific conventions.
```

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

#### If project skills exist

Scan `.claude/skills/` for project-specific skill directories. Note which are relevant to the review (framework guidelines, code style, architecture patterns).

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: QA Verification

Load **[invoke-task-verifiers.md](references/invoke-task-verifiers.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

**STOP.** Do not proceed until ALL task verifiers have returned and findings are aggregated.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Produce Review

Load **[produce-review.md](references/produce-review.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Review Actions

Load **[review-actions-loop.md](references/review-actions-loop.md)** and follow its instructions.
