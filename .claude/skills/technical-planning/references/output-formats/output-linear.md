# Output: Linear

*Output adapter for **[technical-planning](../../SKILL.md)***

---

Use this output format when you want **Linear as the source of truth** for plan management. The user can update tasks directly in Linear's UI, and implementation will query Linear for the current state.

## Setup

Requires the Linear MCP server to be configured in Claude Code.

Check if Linear MCP is available by looking for Linear tools. If not configured, inform the user that Linear MCP is required for this format.

Ask the user: **Which team should own this project?**

## Linear Structure Mapping

| Planning Concept | Linear Entity |
|------------------|---------------|
| Specification/Topic | Project |
| Phase | Label (e.g., `phase-1`, `phase-2`) |
| Task | Issue |
| Internal dependency | Issue blocking relationship (within project) |
| Cross-topic dependency | Issue blocking relationship (across projects) |

Each specification topic becomes its own Linear project. Cross-topic dependencies link issues between projects.

## Cross-Project Dependencies

Cross-topic dependencies link issues between different Linear projects (different specifications/topics). This is how you express "billing depends on authentication being complete."

### Creating Cross-Project Dependencies

Linear supports blocking relationships between issues, even across projects. Via MCP or the Linear UI:

1. Open the dependent issue (the one that's blocked)
2. Add a "Blocked by" relationship to the issue in the other project
3. Linear will show this issue as blocked until the dependency is complete

## Querying Dependencies

Use these queries to understand the dependency graph for implementation blocking and `/link-dependencies`.

### Via MCP

Query Linear for issues with blocking relationships:

```
# Get all issues in a project
linear_getIssues(projectId: "{project_id}")

# Check if an issue has blockers
linear_getIssue(issueId: "{issue_id}")
# Look for blockedByIssues in the response
```

### Check if a Dependency is Complete

Query the blocking issue and check its state:
- `state.type === "completed"` means the dependency is met
- Any other state means it's still blocking

### Find Issues Blocked by a Specific Issue

Via the Linear API or MCP, query for issues where `blockedByIssues` contains the issue ID.

## Output Process

### 1. Create Linear Project

Via MCP, create a project with:

- **Name**: Match the specification topic name
- **Description**: Brief summary + link to specification file
- **Team**: As specified by user

### 2. Create Labels for Phases

Create labels to denote phases (if they don't already exist):

- `phase-1`
- `phase-2`
- etc.

Document the phase goals and acceptance criteria in a pinned issue or the project description:

```
Phase 1: Core Authentication
Goal: Implement basic login/logout flow
Acceptance:
- [ ] User can log in with email/password
- [ ] Session persists across page refresh
- [ ] Logout clears session

Phase 2: ...
```

### 3. Create Issues for Tasks

For each task, create an issue and apply the appropriate phase label:

**Title**: Clear action statement

**Description** (use this structure):
```markdown
## Goal
[What this task accomplishes - one sentence]

## Implementation
[The "Do" from planning - specific files, methods, approach]

## Tests (Micro Acceptance)
- `it does expected behavior`
- `it handles edge case X`

## Edge Cases
- [Specific edge cases for this task]

## Context
Specification: `docs/workflow/specification/{topic}.md`
[Optional: link to specific decision if relevant]
```

**Labels**:
- **Required**: `phase-1`, `phase-2`, etc. - denotes which phase the task belongs to
- **Optional**:
  - `needs-info` - task requires additional information before implementation
  - `edge-case` - for edge case handling tasks
  - `foundation` - for setup/infrastructure tasks
  - `refactor` - for cleanup tasks

### Using `needs-info` Label

When creating issues, if something is unclear or missing from the specification:

1. **Create the issue anyway** - don't block planning
2. **Apply `needs-info` label** - makes gaps visible
3. **Note what's missing** in description - be specific about what needs clarifying
4. **Continue planning** - don't stop and circle back

This allows iterative refinement. Create all issues, identify gaps, circle back to specification if needed, then update issues with missing detail. Plans don't have to be perfect on first pass.

### 4. Create Local Plan File

Create `docs/workflow/planning/{topic}.md`:

```markdown
---
format: linear
plan_id: {PROJECT_NAME}
project_id: {ID from MCP response}
team: {TEAM_NAME}
---

# Plan Reference: {Topic Name}

**Specification**: `docs/workflow/specification/{topic}.md`
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD *(use today's actual date)*

## About This Plan

This plan is managed in Linear. The source of truth for tasks and progress is the Linear project referenced above.

## How to Use

**To view/edit the plan**: Open Linear and navigate to the project.

**Implementation will**:
1. Read this file to find the Linear project
2. Check External Dependencies below
3. Query Linear for project issues
4. Work through tasks in phase order (by label)
5. Update issue status as tasks complete

**To add tasks**: Create issues in the Linear project. They'll be picked up automatically.

## Key Decisions

[Summary of key decisions from specification - for quick reference]

## Cross-Cutting References

Architectural decisions from cross-cutting specifications that inform this plan:

| Specification | Key Decisions | Applies To |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| [Caching Strategy](../../specification/caching-strategy.md) | Cache API responses for 5 min | Tasks involving API calls |
| [Rate Limiting](../../specification/rate-limiting.md) | 100 req/min per user | User-facing endpoints |

*Remove this section if no cross-cutting specifications apply.*

## External Dependencies

[Dependencies on other topics - copy from specification's Dependencies section]

- {topic}: {description}
- {topic}: {description} → {issue-id} (resolved)
```

The External Dependencies section tracks what this plan needs from other topics. See `../dependencies.md` for the format and states (unresolved, resolved, satisfied externally).

## Frontmatter

The frontmatter contains all information needed to query Linear:

```yaml
---
format: linear
plan_id: USER-AUTH-FEATURE
project_id: abc123-def456
team: Engineering
---
```

## Issue Content Guidelines

Issues should be **fully self-contained**. Include all context directly so humans and agents can execute without referencing other files.

**Include in each issue**:
- Goal and rationale (the "why" from the specification)
- What to implement (specific files/methods)
- Test names (micro acceptance)
- Edge cases for this specific task
- Relevant decisions and constraints
- Any code examples for complex patterns

**Specification reference**: The specification at `docs/workflow/specification/{topic}.md` remains available for resolving ambiguity or getting additional context, but issues should contain all information needed for execution.

The goal: anyone (Claude or human) could pick up the issue and execute it without opening another document.

## Benefits

- Visual tracking with real-time progress updates
- Team collaboration with shared visibility
- Update tasks directly in Linear UI without editing markdown
- Integrates with existing Linear workflows

## Resulting Structure

After planning:

```
docs/workflow/
├── discussion/{topic}.md      # Discussion output
├── specification/{topic}.md   # Specification output
└── planning/{topic}.md        # Planning output (format: linear - pointer)

Linear:
└── Project: {topic}
    ├── Issue: Task 1 [label: phase-1]
    ├── Issue: Task 2 [label: phase-1]
    └── Issue: Task 3 [label: phase-2]
```

## Implementation

### Reading Plans

1. Extract `plan_id` (Linear project name) from frontmatter
2. Query Linear MCP for project issues
3. Filter issues by phase label (e.g., `phase-1`, `phase-2`)
4. Process in phase order

### Updating Progress

- Update issue status in Linear via MCP after each task
- User sees real-time progress in Linear UI

### Fallback

If Linear MCP is unavailable:
- Inform the user
- Cannot proceed without MCP access
- Suggest checking MCP configuration or switching to local markdown
