# Plan Construction

*Reference for **[technical-planning](../SKILL.md)***

---

This step constructs the complete plan — defining phases, designing task lists, and authoring every task.

---

## Navigation

At any approval gate during plan construction, the user can navigate. They may describe where they want to go in their own words — a specific phase, a specific task, "the beginning", "the leading edge", or any point in the plan.

The **leading edge** is where new work begins — the first phase, task list, or task that hasn't been completed yet. It is tracked by the `planning:` block in the Plan Index File frontmatter (`phase` and `task`). To find the leading edge, read those values. If all phases and tasks are complete, the leading edge is the end of plan construction.

The `planning:` block always tracks the leading edge. It is only advanced when work is completed — never when the user navigates. Navigation moves the user's position, not the leading edge.

Navigation stays within plan construction. It cannot skip past the end of this step.

## Phase Structure

Load **[define-phases.md](define-phases.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

After the phase structure is approved, continue to **Process Phases** below.

---

## Process Phases

Work through each phase in order.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
I'll now work through each phase — presenting existing work for review
and designing or authoring anything still pending. You'll approve at
every stage.
```

### For each phase, check its state:

#### If the phase has no task table

This phase needs task design.

→ Proceed to **A. Define Tasks** with this phase.

After **A. Define Tasks** returns with an approved task table, proceed to **Author Tasks for the Phase** below.

#### If the phase has a task table

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**Phase {N}: {Phase Name}** — {M} tasks.

{task list from the phase's task table}
```

Check `task_list_gate_mode` in the Plan Index File frontmatter.

#### If `task_list_gate_mode: auto` (existing task table)

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Phase {N}: {Phase Name} — task list confirmed. Proceeding to authoring.
```

→ Proceed to **Author Tasks for the Phase** below.

#### If `task_list_gate_mode: gated` (existing task table)

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**To proceed:**
- **`y`/`yes`** — Confirmed.
- **Or tell me what to change.**
- **Or navigate** — a different phase or task, or the leading edge.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for the user's response.

#### If the user wants changes

→ Proceed to **A. Define Tasks** with this phase for revision.

#### If confirmed

→ Proceed to **Author Tasks for the Phase** below.

## Author Tasks for the Phase

Tasks are authored in a single batch per phase. One sub-agent authors all tasks for the phase, writing to a scratch file. The orchestrator then handles approval and writing to the plan format. Never invoke multiple authoring agents concurrently. Never batch beyond a single phase.

#### If all tasks in the phase have status `authored`

All tasks already written.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Phase {N}: {Phase Name} — all tasks already authored.
```

→ Proceed to the next phase.

#### If any tasks in the phase have status `pending`

→ Proceed to **B. Author Tasks** for the entire phase.

After **B. Author Tasks** returns, all tasks in the phase are authored.

If the user navigates mid-approval, the scratch file preserves approval state. On return, resume from the first non-approved task.

#### When all tasks in the phase are authored

Advance the `planning:` block in frontmatter to the next phase. Commit: `planning({topic}): complete Phase {N} tasks`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Phase {N}: {Phase Name} — complete ({M} tasks authored).
```

Continue to the next phase.

---

## Loop Complete

When all phases have all tasks authored:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
All phases are complete. The plan has **{N} phases** with **{M} tasks** total.
```

---

## A. Define Tasks

Load **[define-tasks.md](define-tasks.md)** and follow its instructions as written. This step designs and approves a task list for **one phase**.

---

## B. Author Tasks

Load **[author-tasks.md](author-tasks.md)** and follow its instructions as written. This step authors **all tasks for the phase** via a batch agent and returns.
