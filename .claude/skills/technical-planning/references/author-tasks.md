# Author Tasks

*Reference for **[technical-planning](../SKILL.md)***

---

This step uses the `planning-task-author` agent (`../../../agents/planning-task-author.md`) to write full detail for all tasks in a phase. One sub-agent authors all tasks, writing to a scratch file. The orchestrator then handles per-task approval and format-specific writing to the plan.

---

## Section 1: Prepare the Scratch File

Scratch file path: `docs/workflow/.cache/planning/{topic}/phase-{N}.md`

Create the `docs/workflow/.cache/planning/{topic}/` directory if it does not exist.

---

## Section 2: Invoke the Agent (Batch)

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Authoring {count} tasks for Phase {N}: {Phase Name}...
```

Invoke `planning-task-author` with these file paths:

1. **read-specification.md**: `read-specification.md`
2. **Specification**: path from the Plan Index File's `specification:` field
3. **Cross-cutting specs**: paths from the Plan Index File's `cross_cutting_specs:` field (if any)
4. **task-design.md**: `task-design.md`
5. **All approved phases**: the complete phase structure from the Plan Index File body
6. **Task list for current phase**: the approved task table (ALL tasks in the phase)
7. **Scratch file path**: `docs/workflow/.cache/planning/{topic}/phase-{N}.md`

The agent writes all tasks to the scratch file and returns.

---

## Section 3: Validate Scratch File

Read the scratch file and count tasks. Verify task count matches the task table in the Plan Index File for this phase.

#### If mismatch

Re-invoke the agent with the same inputs.

#### If valid

→ Proceed to **Section 4**.

---

## Section 4: Check Gate Mode

Check `author_gate_mode` in the Plan Index File frontmatter.

#### If `author_gate_mode: auto`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Phase {N}: {count} tasks authored. Auto-approved. Writing to plan.
```

→ Jump to **Section 6**.

#### If `author_gate_mode: gated`

→ Enter **Section 5**.

---

## Section 5: Approval Loop

For each task in the scratch file, in order:

#### If task status is `approved`

Skip — already approved from a previous pass.

#### If task status is `pending`

Present the full task content:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
{task detail from scratch file}
```

**Task {M} of {total}: {Task Name}**

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**To proceed:**
- **`y`/`yes`** — Approved. I'll write it to the plan.
- **`a`/`auto`** — Approve this and all remaining tasks automatically
- **Or tell me what to change.**
- **Or navigate** — a different phase or task, or the leading edge.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for the user's response.

#### If approved (`y`/`yes`)

Mark the task `approved` in the scratch file. Continue to the next task.

#### If `auto`

Mark the task `approved` in the scratch file. Set all remaining `pending` tasks to `approved`. Update `author_gate_mode: auto` in the Plan Index File frontmatter.

→ Jump to **Section 6**.

#### If the user provides feedback

Mark the task `rejected` in the scratch file and add the feedback as a blockquote:

```markdown
## {task-id} | rejected

> **Feedback**: {user's feedback here}

### Task {seq}: {Task Name}
...
```

Continue to the next task.

#### If the user navigates

→ Return to **Plan Construction**. The scratch file preserves approval state.

---

### Section 5b: Revision

After completing the approval loop, check for rejected tasks.

#### If no rejected tasks

→ Proceed to **Section 6**.

#### If rejected tasks exist

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
{N} tasks need revision. Re-invoking author agent...
```

→ Return to **Section 2**. The agent receives the scratch file with rejected tasks and feedback, rewrites only those, and the flow continues through validation, gate check, and approval as normal.

---

## Section 6: Write to Plan

> **CHECKPOINT**: If `author_gate_mode: gated`, verify all tasks in the scratch file are marked `approved` before writing.

For each approved task in the scratch file, in order:

1. Read the task content from the scratch file
2. Write to the output format (format-specific — see the format's **[authoring.md](output-formats/{format}/authoring.md)**)
3. Update the task table in the Plan Index File: set `status: authored` and set `Ext ID` to the external identifier for the task as exposed by the output format
4. If the Plan Index File frontmatter `ext_id` is empty, set it to the external identifier for the plan as exposed by the output format
5. If the current phase's `ext_id` is empty, set it to the external identifier for the phase as exposed by the output format
6. Advance the `planning:` block in frontmatter to the next pending task (or next phase if this was the last task)
7. Commit: `planning({topic}): author task {task-id} ({task name})`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Task {M} of {total}: {Task Name} — authored.
```

Repeat for each task.

---

## Section 7: Cleanup

Delete the scratch file: `rm docs/workflow/.cache/planning/{topic}/phase-{N}.md`

Remove the `docs/workflow/.cache/planning/{topic}/` directory if empty.

→ Return to **Plan Construction**.
