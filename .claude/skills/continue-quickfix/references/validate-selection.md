Validate the selected work unit against the discovery output and store its data.

#### If `work_unit` not found in quick_fixes array

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
No active quick-fix named "{work_unit}" found.

Run /continue-quickfix to see available quick-fixes, or /start-quickfix to begin a new one.
```
