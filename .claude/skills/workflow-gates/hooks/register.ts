/**
 * workflow-gates — the agentic-workflows engine's gates drawn above the
 * prompt instead of printed by the model.
 *
 * The engine states each gate as data beside the menu it composed. This
 * module announces itself so the engine collects it, arms the gate off the
 * Bash result that carried it, cuts the menu out of what the model reads, and
 * draws the rows in the band once the model's turn is over. A press picks its
 * row's answer into the prompt box; a second press on that row sends it as the
 * next message, which the workflows' prose reads as the answer, or while
 * Claude works on anything else holds it until Claude finishes. In a session
 * that announced, what the band shows is kept in the conversation's folder
 * across a restart, so a conversation resumed where nothing has happened
 * since shows its gate again.
 *
 * Every path up to the cut fails open: the engine emits the menu regardless,
 * so where the module never loads, or a cut throws or overruns, the model
 * reads the text menu the engine wrote.
 *
 * The module also sets Claude Code's harness for the workflows: every session
 * gets the SendUserMessage tool, kept behind ToolSearch, and a conversation
 * the engine has marked as running the workflows goes without Claude's
 * thinking summarised as output and without the nudge to say what it is
 * doing, the person's own values of both put back as it ends. A conversation
 * the engine has not marked keeps them untouched.
 *
 * All of it happens in Claude Code's terminal app alone, from 2.1.282.
 * Elsewhere — an IDE extension, Claude Code on the web, an older Claude
 * Code — the session is not announced, and the module draws, keeps and sets
 * nothing.
