Invoke the [technical-research](../../technical-research/SKILL.md) skill for feature research.

```
Research session for: {topic}
Work type: feature

Initial context from feature interview:
{compiled feature context from gather-feature-context}

Uncertainties to explore:
{list of uncertainties identified in research-gating}

Create research file: .workflows/research/{topic}.md

The research frontmatter should include:
- topic: {topic}
