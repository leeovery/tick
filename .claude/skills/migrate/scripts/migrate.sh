# migrate.sh
#
# Keeps workflow files in sync with the current system design.
# Runs all migration scripts in order, tracking progress to avoid redundant processing.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/migrate.sh
#
# Tracking:
#   Migrations are tracked in .workflows/.state/migrations
#   Format: "migration_id" per line (e.g., "001", "002")
#   The orchestrator checks/records migration IDs — individual scripts don't track.
#   Delete the log file to force re-running all migrations.
#
# Adding new migrations:
#   1. Create scripts/migrations/NNN-description.sh (e.g., 002-spec-frontmatter.sh)
#   2. The script will be run automatically in numeric order
#   3. Each migration script receives helper functions via source: report_update, report_skip
