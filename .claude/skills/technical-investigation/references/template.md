## Section Guidelines

### Symptoms Section

Gather all observable information about the bug before analyzing code. This creates a clear target for analysis and helps validate the fix.

### Analysis Section

Document your investigation journey. Even dead ends are valuable — they show what's NOT the cause and help others avoid the same paths.

### Fix Direction Section

Don't detail the implementation here — that's for the specification. Focus on high-level direction, alternatives, and risk assessment.
