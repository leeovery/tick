# Knowledge Usage

*Reference for **[workflow-knowledge](../SKILL.md)** — loaded by processing skills (research, discussion, investigation, scoping, planning, implementation, review).*

This reference sets expectations for how you use the knowledge base *during* a phase — when to query, how to construct queries, how to interpret results, and what to do if a query fails. Load it early in the phase so the guidance is active from the first substantive step.

For API details (commands, flags, output format, confidence tiers, two-step retrieval), load **[SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)** — the knowledge skill's API documentation.

## A. When to query

Query proactively throughout the phase. Under-querying is the bigger risk — the knowledge base is cheap to check and valuable when prior work exists. Trust your judgement and err on the side of querying.

Four trigger heuristics. If any fires, query:

1. **Topic boundaries** — the conversation is at the edge of the current topic, brushing up against adjacent territory that may have been explored elsewhere. ("This auth discussion is starting to touch session handling — was that covered in another work unit?")
2. **Upstream/downstream dependencies** — something being discussed might affect or be affected by other parts of the system. ("This data-model change has implications for billing — have we discussed billing's assumptions about this field?")
3. **Unfamiliar territory** — you're not sure whether a topic has been explored before in this project. When in doubt, check.
4. **User prompts** — the user asks "have we discussed this?", "is there prior context?", "what was decided about X?", or anything similar.

Multiple queries from different angles are expected and encouraged. One query for the decision, one for the constraint, one for the rejected alternative — each surfaces different context.

## B. How to construct queries

Use **natural language** describing what you're looking for — not topic slugs, which are weak semantic signal. Filter with `--work-unit`, `--work-type`, `--phase`, `--topic` (hard filters — non-matching chunks excluded). Bias results with `--boost:<field> <value>` (re-rank hint; repeatable; valid fields: `work-unit`, `work-type`, `phase`, `topic`, `confidence`). For multiple angles in one invocation, pass multiple positional terms (batch query).

See **[SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)** — query construction examples and the full flag table.

## C. Two-step retrieval

Chunks land in context; read the source file (from the `Source:` line) only when a chunk looks load-bearing. See **[SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)** — two-step retrieval pattern.

A `[baseline | …]` hit is the project baseline — observed and user-stated context about the codebase as the workflows found it. Reference, never record: it informs the conversation, but it never settles a decision the way a discussion or specification chunk does, and a stated rationale worth building on is confirmed with the user rather than silently assumed current. Baseline chunks also never decay — a claim the code has since outgrown is worth flagging to the user rather than trusting it to fade.

A `[roadmap | …]` hit is the product-level record — a roadmap session's exploration, staged thinking about capabilities that may never have been pulled. Exploration-grade, never a decision of record, and it may carry ground a pull's fence deliberately left behind: material beyond the work unit's pulled items informs the conversation but never silently widens the work's scope.

## D. Query failure handling

If `knowledge query` exits with a non-zero code, **pause the workflow**. Do not silently proceed without context — the knowledge base is high-value enough that silent skips are worse than a brief interruption.

1. Capture the error output.
2. Surface it to the user using the display block below.
3. Offer two options — fix and retry, or explicitly proceed without knowledge.
4. If the user chooses to proceed, continue the phase but record that knowledge retrieval was skipped so the user knows context may be missing.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
⚑ Knowledge query failed
  {error output}

  Likely causes: expired API key, network outage, corrupted store,
  or provider mismatch. Run `knowledge status` to diagnose.
```

Fetch the gate and emit its section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render query-failure-gate
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `retry`

Re-run the query. If it fails again, surface again (same choice). If it succeeds, the caller will interpret the fresh results.

→ Return to caller.

#### If `skip`

Note in the current phase's working file that the knowledge query was skipped. Example: append a short note under a relevant section — *"Knowledge base query skipped ({YYYY-MM-DD}) — prior context may be missing."* — so the user can audit later.

→ Return to caller.

## E. When a surfaced artifact is wrong

A chunk (or its source file) can carry a claim you have verified is wrong or has shifted since it was written. What happens next depends on the source phase.

#### If the source is a specification

Never leave it standing — the spec is the golden record and its chunks stay live at full confidence, so every future query re-serves the error as validated context.

→ Load **[correcting-historical-artifacts.md](../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** and follow its instructions.

#### If the source is any other phase

Leave the artifact alone — no correction is owed. Everything outside the specification decays in the knowledge base; record what is actually true in the current work's own artifact and let the stale claim age out.

→ Return to caller.

## F. Phase-specific notes

- **Research** — query at the start of the phase (via the contextual query step) and throughout. Early phases have the highest chance of overlapping with prior work — research is often where the same ground gets explored twice if we don't check.
- **Discussion** — query at the start and throughout. Decisions being made now often echo or contradict decisions made elsewhere. Check before committing to a direction.
- **Investigation** — query at the start (after initial symptoms are gathered) and throughout. Symptoms and root causes may have been seen before — a matching prior investigation can save hours.
- **Specification** — **do not query while authoring the spec.** The spec turns discussion decisions into a golden document. Cross-cutting concerns merge at planning time via an explicit cross-cutting query, not during spec authoring. Querying mid-spec pulls the document away from its own source material. Exception: the grouping/consolidation analysis at specification *entry* may run one advisory `--phase discussion` query to surface candidate consult references (sibling discussions owing a correction) — that is intake, not authoring, and never injects content into the spec body.
- **Scoping** — query throughout. Quick-fix scoping benefits from knowing if the issue was discussed or investigated elsewhere — a "mechanical change" often has a history.
- **Planning** — **do not query during planning.** The spec is the golden document; planning operates on the spec alone. If a spec gap surfaces during planning, flag it to the user — don't fill it with a KB query. Cross-cutting context is handled at planning entry via the explicit `--work-type cross-cutting` query (existing mechanism, not discretionary).
- **Implementation** — code is the source of truth for *what* exists during implementation. Read the code; don't query the KB for it. The KB is useful only for the *why* behind an existing pattern or decision (e.g., "why does this use UUID v7?" — the rationale lives in spec/discussion, not the code). Rare in practice. Never use it to fill spec gaps — those are blockers.
- **Review** — query only for cross-work-unit consistency checks ("does this mirror how similar decisions were made elsewhere?"). Consistency with the current spec is already in scope — no KB needed for that.

## G. Sibling consult at cross-topic decision points

A decision that names an entity, field, rule, or classification this topic's own artifact didn't introduce is deciding on ground another document may own. The trigger is local — whether this artifact introduced the term is checkable against the current file; whether another document owns it is exactly what the consult finds out. **Citation is not introduction**: a term this artifact only carries by citing another topic's decision was introduced there, and a new decision naming it triggers the consult however familiar the term reads in this file.

Before documenting such a decision:

1. **Consult** — run a scoped query for the term, or cite the sibling's current decided text when it is already in this session's context.
2. **Trace** — record the check as one line inside the documented decision: `Sibling check: {topic} — {what its decided text holds}`, or `Sibling check: no overlap found.`

When the consult surfaces text the new decision contradicts or supersedes, route by owner. Text that *anticipates* the decision — a lean recorded as a lean, a question the sibling deferred or triaged to this topic — is neither: the deferral is its forward pointer, nothing is owed, and no reroute fires. A sibling topic in the same epic: reroute through the session's off-topic path at that moment. Another work unit's specification: it is owed a correction — never a prose note to carry — follow **E. When a surfaced artifact is wrong**. Any other document of another work unit: no correction is owed — this topic's own record of the decision stands, and the stale text ages out (**E**'s non-spec arm).

In ordinary conversation this is the same advisory judgment as §A trigger 2. At engagement decision points — a review or synthesis finding's outcome, a rerouted triage concern's fold — the consult is a required step; the engagement flows name it.

→ Return to caller.
