# Workflow Knowledge

CLI tool for querying the workflow knowledge base — a retrieval-augmented store of all completed workflow artifacts, searchable by semantics or keyword. This file is the API documentation layer. Load it when you need to construct a query or interpret results.

## What the knowledge base is

A local semantic-search index over every completed research, discussion, investigation, and specification artifact in `.workflows/`, plus markdown imports and promoted seeds indexed as they land, the gap-analysis cache indexed when topic-discovery rewrites it, epic discovery session logs indexed at each harvest, the product-road session logs and roadmap imports (`.workflows/.roadmap/`) indexed at each session close and landing, and the project baseline docs indexed as each area completes. Content is stored at full fidelity — chunks are the actual text, not summaries — with provenance metadata attached: which work unit, which phase, which topic, and the source document's date. The knowledge directory (`.workflows/.knowledge/` — the store, its metadata, and the knowledge `config.json` setup writes) is local to each checkout and never committed: the store is derived from the committed artifacts, each checkout sets up and builds its own, and a worktree Claude Code creates starts with a copy of all three.

**Why it exists**: to surface prior context that would otherwise be lost across work units or forgotten within one. A spec written three months ago, a discussion that rejected an approach, an investigation that ruled out a cause — all remain queryable.

**What is indexed**:

- `research` (low confidence — exploratory, may contain dead ends)
- `discussion` (low-medium — conversational, may contain corrected assumptions)
- `investigation` (medium — diagnostic, tied to specific symptoms)
- `specification` (high — validated decisions, "what we decided to build")
- `imports` (low — user-shared reference material, often loose, may contain multiple topics. Markdown only — any other import keeps its own extension, is tracked on the manifest's `imports[]`, and is never indexed; `index <path>` refuses it by name)
- `seeds` (low — the work unit's origin: the promoted inbox item(s), verbatim capture)
- `analysis` (low — the gap-analysis cache, a meta-summary derived from low-confidence material)
- `discovery` (low — epic exploration logs: the running record, not validated decisions; topic = session, so a work unit's whole discovery is `--phase discovery --work-unit {wu}`)
- `baseline` (low — the project baseline: brownfield assessment docs at `.workflows/.baseline/{topic}.md`, project-level rather than per-work-unit. Chunks carry the reserved pseudo-identity `baseline` for both work unit and work type. Observed and user-stated context about the pre-existing codebase — it informs, but is never a settled call a phase may lean on silently)
- `roadmap` (low — the product-road session logs at `.workflows/.roadmap/sessions/session-NNN.md`: the running record of product-altitude conversation, graded like discovery logs; topic = session. Project-level — chunks carry the reserved pseudo-identity `roadmap` for both work unit and work type. Roadmap imports land at `.workflows/.roadmap/imports/{name}` under the same identity with phase `imports`, markdown alone indexed)

**What is NOT indexed**: planning, implementation, review. These phases describe execution, not knowledge. Searching them would surface task IDs and code fragments, not insight. Operational `.state/` files (migrations, environment-setup) are also excluded — only the gap-analysis cache filename is accepted from `.state/`.

## Invocation

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs <command> [args]
```

Every skill that calls this must declare `Bash(node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs)` in its `allowed-tools` frontmatter.

To list commands and options, use `--help` / `-h` / `help` — writes usage to stdout, exits 0. Invoking the CLI with no arguments writes usage to stderr and exits 1.

---

## `query` — search the knowledge base

### Single query

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs query "<search term>" [flags]
```

### Batch query

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs query "<term1>" "<term2>" "<termN>" [flags]
```

Multiple positional arguments run separate searches in one invocation, merge the results, deduplicate by chunk ID (highest score wins), then apply `--limit` to the merged set. Efficient — one store load, multiple searches. Encouraged when you want to attack the same topic from different angles.

### Flags

| Flag | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `--work-unit <wu>` | Filter to one or more work units. Comma-separated list accepted. Hard filter — non-matching chunks excluded |
| `--work-type <type>` | Filter results to a work type. Comma-separated list accepted (e.g., `--work-type cross-cutting` or `--work-type epic,feature`). Hard filter |
| `--phase <phase>` | Filter to one or more phases. Same comma-separated syntax. Hard filter |
| `--topic <topic>` | Filter to one or more topics. Same comma-separated syntax. Hard filter |
| `--boost:<field> <value>` | **Re-ranking hint, NOT a filter.** Boosts chunks where `<field>` equals `<value>` by `+0.1` per match, additive — keyword-only, that only breaks near-ties. Repeatable. Valid fields: `work-unit`, `work-type`, `phase`, `topic`, `confidence`. Use it to say "I'm currently working in `auth-flow`, prefer its context" via `--boost:work-unit auth-flow` — results from other work units still appear |
| `--limit <n>` | Cap result count after merge + re-rank. Default 10 |
| `--explain` | Print beneath each result how it ranked — for diagnosing retrieval, never needed to use the results |

### Search modes

Two modes, settled per query:

- **Hybrid** (the store was built with the provider, model and dimensions the config names): every term embedded in one request, keyword and vector searches blended, results re-ranked by any `--boost:<field>` directives you pass, plus an always-on confidence-tier boost and a progress-based decay that down-ranks units the project has moved past.
- **Keyword-only**: full-text search only. Still useful — you lose semantic expansion, but a word still finds its other forms (`limit` finds `limiting`), and the commonest words (`the`, `of`, `is`) match nothing. A supported degraded mode, not a broken state. The output opens with a note naming why, and the fix:
  - no provider configured — `[keyword-only mode — configure embedding provider for semantic search]`;
  - a provider configured over a keyword-only store — the next start embeds the store, no rebuild;
  - whatever keeps the query from a vector the store can compare — a key that does not resolve, a provider down or unreachable, a rate limit that outlasts the query's waiting, an account out of quota, a config that dropped its provider, a store built with another provider, model or dimensions (fixed by `knowledge rebuild`).

A query never fails for want of a vector: whatever its note says, it exits `0` with its results. Nor does it stall on the provider: each request gets 5 seconds to answer and a second try, and a rate limit only the waiting a query is allowed (see `index`), before the query runs keyword-only.

### Query construction

Use **natural language**, not topic slugs. A query is a short description of what you're looking for, framed the way the original author would have written about it.

- Good: `"OAuth2 PKCE flow for mobile clients"`
- Good: `"why we ruled out email as a primary identity field"`
- Poor: `"auth-flow"` (topic slug — weak semantic signal)
- Poor: `"auth"` (too broad — matches everything auth-related)

Descriptive, specific, phrased in the language likely to appear in the source material. Multiple queries from different angles are encouraged — one for the decision, one for the constraint, one for the rejected alternative.

### Output format

```
[3 results]

[specification | auth-flow/auth-flow | high | 2026-03-15]
User identity uses UUID v7. Email is a profile attribute, not an identifier.
Source: .workflows/auth-flow/specification/auth-flow/specification.md

[discussion | payments-overhaul/data-model | low-medium | 2026-03-10]
Debated UUID vs email for identity. UUID won because email changes are common.
Source: .workflows/payments-overhaul/discussion/data-model.md

[research | payments-overhaul/identity | low | 2026-02-28]
Explored identity approaches. Email-based ruled out due to GDPR right-to-erasure.

```

- **Header line**: `[N results]` where N is the merged, deduplicated, re-ranked count after `--limit`.
- **Provenance line** (per chunk): `[phase | work_unit/topic | confidence | YYYY-MM-DD]`. Date is the source document's date (file mtime).
- **Content**: the chunk text verbatim. No summarisation, no truncation.
- **Source line**: the path to the source artifact. Use this with the two-step retrieval pattern below.
- **Blank line** between chunks.
- **Empty results**: a `[0 results]` header — no provenance lines, nothing beneath it. Treat as "no prior context found" — move on.
- **Notes** (when applicable): one line each, above the header — why the query ran keyword-only (see Search modes), and, over a store with chunks awaiting vectors, `[N chunks await vectors — searched by keyword alone; each start retries them]`.
- **Explanation** (`--explain` only): beneath each source line, a `Framing N:` line per term — its keyword score and vector similarity, each raw → over its search's best (`absent` where that search missed the chunk), and their blend (keyword-only: the raw keyword score). A framing whose hits, cut to twice the limit, lack the chunk reads `not in its top 20` at the default limit, whether or not the term matched it. Then `Score:` names the framing whose score the chunk kept and works it through decay, boosts and confidence tier to the final value.

### Confidence tiers — how to weigh results

Confidence is intrinsic to the source phase. It tells you how much weight to give the content, not whether to use it.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `high` | Specification — a decision that was validated and written down. Trust the *what*, verify the *why* against the source if it matters |
| `medium` | Investigation — diagnostic work tied to specific symptoms. Trust the diagnosis, but check whether the symptom is still current |
| `low-medium` | Discussion — conversational, may contain assumptions that were corrected later in the same file. Read for context, not conclusions |
| `low` | Research, Imports, Seeds, Analysis, Discovery, Roadmap, or Baseline — research is exploratory (may be a dead end, rejected path, or unvalidated idea); imports are user-supplied reference material (often loose, may cover multiple topics surface-level); seeds are raw inbox captures (the work unit's origin, unrefined); analysis caches are meta-summaries derived from research/discussion (themes and gaps surfaced, not validated decisions); discovery logs are the running exploration record; roadmap session logs are the product-altitude exploration record, the same grade one level up; baseline docs are observed/stated context about the pre-existing codebase, reference never record. Disambiguate via the provenance line's phase field |

**Low confidence is not low value.** A research chunk that rejected an approach prevents the next work unit from re-exploring the same dead end. A discussion chunk showing a corrected assumption explains *why* the spec says what it says. Don't filter out low-confidence results — weigh them.

### Two-step retrieval pattern

1. **Query** returns chunks with provenance. Lightweight — lands in your context window.
2. **Read the source file** (from the `Source:` line) only if a chunk looks load-bearing for what you're doing.

Don't read source files for every result. Most queries produce a couple of chunks that are mildly relevant and one that's directly relevant — read the one, skim the rest from the chunk text alone. This keeps context lean while preserving full-fidelity access on demand.

### What NOT to do

- **Do not dump large result sets speculatively.** `--limit 50` with a vague query produces noise. Prefer a focused query with the default limit.
- **Do not use topic slugs as search terms.** `"auth-flow"` is a weak semantic signal. Describe the thing, don't name it.
- **Do not query while authoring the spec.** Spec turns discussion decisions into a golden document. Cross-cutting concerns merge at planning time via an explicit cross-cutting query, not during spec authoring. Querying mid-spec pulls the spec away from its own source material. The lone exception is the grouping/consolidation analysis at specification *entry*, which may run one advisory `--phase discussion` query to surface candidate consult references — that is intake (choosing inputs), not authoring, and never injects content into the spec body.
- **Do not prepend metadata to the query string.** The CLI already filters by `work-unit`, `work-type`, `phase`, `topic` via flags. `"auth-flow specification UUID identity"` is worse than `"UUID identity"` with `--phase specification`.
- **Reach for `--boost:<field>` before `--work-unit`.** Filtering by work unit excludes cross-work-unit context — usually the opposite of what you want. `--boost:work-unit <current>` nudges results toward your current work unit — keyword-only, only on near-ties — while keeping prior work from other units in the pool. Stack multiple boosts (`--boost:work-unit X --boost:phase specification`) when your query wants multi-dimensional preference, not exclusion.

## `check` — readiness probe

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs check
```

Exit code is always `0` (unless the filesystem itself is unreadable). Output on stdout:

- `ready` — knowledge base is initialised and the store is loadable
- `buildable` — this checkout is set up (its local `.workflows/.knowledge/config.json`) but has no store, and this machine's config says how to build one: a provider whose key resolves, or keyword-only chosen outright — a system config holding knowledge settings that name no provider, or a project config unsetting the provider. No system config, an invalid one, or a provider whose key cannot be resolved is never read as a keyword-only choice
- `not-ready` — missing directory, missing config, unloadable store, or a missing store this machine cannot build

Skills branch on the stdout string, not the exit code. Used in Step 0 of entry-point skills (via `engine boot`): `buildable` has the bulk `index` build the store; `not-ready` routes into the knowledge gate, which drives `knowledge setup` through its non-interactive forms.

---

## `index` — write to the store

```bash
# Single artifact (used by phase-completion steps)
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs index <path/to/artifact.md>

# Bulk index (no file — brings the store in line with the files)
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs index [--work-unit <wu>]
```

- **With a file**: re-indexing replaces existing chunks for that file (idempotent). The path must match `.workflows/{work_unit}/{phase}/...` so identity can be derived. For imports, the path is `.workflows/{work_unit}/imports/{filename}.md` and the topic is the filename basename without extension — a non-markdown import is refused by name. For the gap-analysis cache, the path is `.workflows/{work_unit}/.state/discovery-gap-analysis.md`; the phase is `analysis` and the topic is `gap-analysis`. For baseline docs, the path is `.workflows/.baseline/{topic}.md`; the work unit and phase are both `baseline` (removal is `remove --work-unit baseline [--phase baseline --topic <t>]`). For roadmap material, the paths are `.workflows/.roadmap/sessions/session-NNN.md` (work unit `roadmap`, phase `roadmap`, topic = session basename) and `.workflows/.roadmap/imports/{name}.md` (work unit `roadmap`, phase `imports`); removal is `remove --work-unit roadmap [--phase … --topic …]`.
- **Without a file**: the bulk index. A checkout with no store gets one, in the mode this machine's config names — empty when there is nothing to index, its metadata replacing any left without a store. Every chunk records the sha256 of the content it was indexed from; the bulk index compares that against each discovered artifact (completed phase artifacts, the markdown `imports[]` and `seeds[]` entries, gap-analysis caches, closed epic discovery sessions, closed roadmap sessions and roadmap imports, baseline docs — a live session's log is indexed when it closes) and indexes the ones with no chunks (`new`) or with chunks from other content (`changed` — a chunk with no recorded hash counts as changed; a file with a chunk awaiting its vector is cut again, and counts as changed when its chunk texts differ from the stored ones); the rest are `unchanged`. It skips the non-spec artifacts `compact` prunes, so it never re-embeds them. It then removes the chunks of identities positively known to be gone, deciding from the manifests as they stand when it writes: a source file inside the project no longer on disk, a work unit absent from a non-empty registry or cancelled, and a research/discussion/investigation/specification item absent from its manifest or `superseded`, `cancelled`, `postponed`, or `promoted`. An `in-progress` item (a reopened topic) keeps its chunks; baseline and roadmap chunks go only with their files; a work unit whose manifest cannot be read keeps its chunks. `--work-unit <wu>` confines both halves to one unit. Output is a line per file acted on, then `N new, N changed, N removed, N unchanged.` (`, N failed` when any file failed to index, `, N chunks awaiting vectors` when any chunk's vectors failed). Run by `engine boot` at every start, by setup, and by the lifecycle re-index.
- **Keywords first, then vectors.** Either form writes each file's chunks searchable by keyword — carrying the vector of any text the store already holds — then embeds the chunks still without one, about 100 texts to a request, saving each batch as it lands. The bulk index embeds every chunk awaiting a vector in its scope — a pruned one excepted — so a chunk whose embed failed gets its vector at the next start, bar one the endpoint refused. A keyword-only store takes a provider configured over it at its next index, and every chunk its vector — no rebuild. Over a store built with a provider whose key does not resolve, the chunks are written all the same, each file's vectors failing with the key's fix, and the bulk index exits non-zero naming it (`Cannot embed: …`) even with no chunk awaiting a vector. A store built with one provider, model or dimensions refuses another, as it refuses a config that names no provider: that takes a `knowledge rebuild`.
- A rate-limited request (HTTP 429) waits the time the provider names — capped at a minute, growing waits when it names none — and is retried alone, up to five times. An index waits at most 60 seconds in all, a query 5: a request whose wait does not fit what remains fails at once, as does one from an account out of quota. Other transient failures (network, server error, lock, store I/O) are retried with exponential backoff; a rejected request (HTTP 400/413/422), a bad key, or a provider configuration the model contradicts fails at once. A file that still fails to index exits non-zero — the single-file form says the next start retries it. A file whose vectors fail is written all the same: stderr names it (`Failed to embed <file>: …`) and says it is searchable by keyword — its vectors coming at the next start, or, where the endpoint refused a chunk of it, that chunk going without one — and the command exits non-zero. When the endpoint refuses an input in a batch, the batch is embedded file by file, and a refused file text by text, so the refused text alone goes without its vector; any other failure stops the embedding, the files left awaiting named with it. The bulk index attempts every file, names each failure on stderr, and exits non-zero at the end. A manifest the bulk index cannot read aborts it before anything is removed.
- Exits non-zero if the file doesn't exist, the path can't be parsed, or the path names a non-markdown import — and, either form, when there is no store to write and this machine's config does not say how to create one (the rule `buildable` states): a provider whose key cannot be resolved is never stood in for by a keyword-only store, and no configuration at all is never read as a keyword-only choice.

Typically invoked by processing skills at phase completion — not queried by Claude during a phase.

---

## `remove` — remove chunks

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs remove --work-unit <wu> [--phase <p>] [--topic <t>] [--dry-run]
```

Removes chunks matching the given filter. Granularity:

- `--work-unit <wu>` alone — removes every chunk for that work unit
- `--work-unit <wu> --phase <p>` — narrows to one phase
- `--work-unit <wu> --phase <p> --topic <t>` — narrows to one topic

Used when a spec is superseded or promoted, or when a work unit is cancelled. `--topic` requires `--phase`. `--dry-run` counts what the filter matches and reports it without touching the store.

Output: `Removed N chunks for {scope}`. Exits non-zero on usage errors and when the removal fails.

---

## `status` — full health report

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs status
```

Human-readable report of the store's state: chunk counts by work unit, phase, and work type; last-indexed timestamp; provider info; the mode a query runs in — keyword-only naming why and the fix, in its note's words; the chunks awaiting vectors in a store built with a provider; a knowledge config that cannot load, named; and what the next bulk `index` does — completed artifacts not yet indexed, artifacts changed since they were indexed, artifacts pruned below the decay floor (never counted as unindexed or changed), and indexed identities it retires, each with its reason. Not used in skill automation — intended for debugging and user inspection.

---

## `rebuild` and `compact` — maintenance commands

- **`rebuild`** — destructive. Deletes the existing index and re-indexes everything currently discoverable: completed phase artifacts (research, discussion, investigation, specification), the markdown entries on each work unit's `imports[]` and `seeds[]` arrays, epic discovery session logs (`discovery/sessions/session-NNN.md`), any present gap-analysis caches (`.state/discovery-gap-analysis.md`), the roadmap sessions and markdown imports (`.workflows/.roadmap/`), and the project baseline docs (`.workflows/.baseline/*.md`). Prompts the user to type `rebuild` literally to confirm — refusing before the prompt, the store untouched, where this machine's config does not say how to create a store (the rule `buildable` states). **Human-only** — Claude cannot run it (interactive prompt). Non-deterministic: rebuilt chunks won't match the originals (embedding variance, edited artifacts).
- **`compact [--dry-run]`** — storage backstop. Removes a work unit's non-spec chunks once their retrievability `R` has decayed below `decay_prune_below` — i.e. once enough later work has completed that they're effectively unreachable in query ranking. Decay is progress-based (how much work completed after the unit, weighted by work type), not wall-clock; specifications are exempt; `false` disables it. `--dry-run` previews without deleting.

Skills do not call these directly. `engine boot` runs the bulk `knowledge index` and then `compact` at every start; `rebuild` is the user's.

---

## `setup` — initialise the knowledge base

Handles system config (`~/.config/workflows/config.json`), this checkout's init (`.workflows/.knowledge/` — never committed, so every copy of the project sets up once), and initial indexing of all completed artifacts. An artifact that fails to index, or a chunk that fails to embed, does not fail setup: the output names how many, and the bulk `knowledge index` at the next start retries them. Config resolves defaults ← system ← project; `null` unsets a key. Setup writes provider identity only — the tuning keys `similarity_threshold` (the vector leg's cosine floor, 0.3), `decay_prune_below` (0.05; `false` disables), `decay_base_stability` (5) and `decay_weights` (per work type) are honoured as overrides in either file and never written. Two surfaces: an interactive wizard (no flags) and non-interactive forms (flag-dispatched) that skills can run.

**The API key never passes through a flag, a chat, or stdout.** There is deliberately no `--key` flag — any setup invocation carrying one is refused (argv lands in shell history and process listings). Keys resolve from the provider env var (`$OPENAI_API_KEY` — wins) or `~/.config/workflows/credentials.json` (mode 0600, written by `--key-only` or the wizard). Setup output names active settings only (provider · model), never key material.

### Non-interactive forms

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --from-system
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --keyword-only
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --provider openai --model <m> [--dimensions <d>]
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --provider openai-compatible --base-url <u> --model <m> --dimensions <d>
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs setup --key-only [--provider <id>]
```

- **`--from-system`** — reuse the existing system config: resolve the key (env → credentials; providerless configs need none), validate provider configs with one test embed, create the project store, bulk-index the existing artifacts, print the active-settings summary. Refuses clearly when the system config is missing/invalid or the openai key is unresolvable (the message names the env var and the `--key-only` remedy).
- **`--keyword-only`** — project-level keyword-only init: project config, empty store, provider-null metadata. Never touches the system config — the project config always pins `provider: null`, so this checkout runs keyword-only whatever the machine's system config names, and when its store goes missing it is `buildable` keyword-only. A system config it cannot read is refused before anything is written. Idempotent; partial states fill in; a store without metadata refuses toward `knowledge rebuild`.
- **`--provider ...`** — write the system config from flags (validation embed first — a broken provider never lands on disk), then proceed as `--from-system`. Every system-config write rewrites the `knowledge` key whole — provider identity only, so a tuning override set there (`similarity_threshold`, `decay_prune_below`) does not carry across a provider change; other subsystems' top-level keys (e.g. `session`) are preserved. `openai` requires a resolvable key; `openai-compatible` allows keyless endpoints and requires `--dimensions` (must match the model's native output).
- **`--key-only`** — the terminal detour: a masked readline prompt for the key alone (TTY-required; non-TTY aborts), written to `credentials.json` (mode 0600), then exit. `--provider` selects which provider the key is stored under (default `openai`).

### Interactive wizard

`setup` with no flags runs the guided wizard — **human-only**, prompts throughout via readline; non-TTY invocations abort with `knowledge setup requires an interactive terminal`. Safe to re-run: per-step prompts detect existing state and offer skip or reconfigure; the bulk index at the end only indexes what is new or changed.

The provider menu offers `openai` (cloud, requires an API key), `openai-compatible` (any local/self-hosted OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint — LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM), or `skip` (keyword-only). For `openai-compatible`, the wizard collects `base_url` (required), `model`, and `dimensions`; the API key is **optional** (press Enter to omit for open servers) and is stored only in `credentials.json` — there is no env-var override. `base_url` is consumed only under the `openai-compatible` provider and ignored under `openai`. Configured dimensions must match the local model's native output; the validation embed fails loudly on a mismatch.

---

## Exit codes

- `0` — success, `check` reporting any state, or a `query` run keyword-only for want of a vector
- Non-zero — usage error, a knowledge config that cannot be read or names a provider that cannot be built, file not found, unparseable path, lock contention exceeded, an index refusing a provider the store was not built with, an index or remove that failed (an index also when any chunk's vectors failed, and a bulk index over a store whose provider key does not resolve), or a `query` over a store that cannot be read or whose metadata is missing

`query` with zero results exits `0` and prints a `[0 results]` header. `check` exits `0` for `ready`, `buildable`, and `not-ready` alike. Both semantics are intentional — skills branch on output, not on the exit code.
