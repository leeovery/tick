# Analysis Loop

*Reference for **[workflow-implementation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Each cycle follows stages A through H sequentially. Always start at **A. Cycle Gate**.

```
A. Cycle gate (record the cycle, warn if over the lifetime cycle limit)
B. Git checkpoint
C. Dispatch analysis agents → invoke-analysis.md
D. Dispatch synthesis agent → invoke-synthesizer.md
E. Approval overview (spec defects settled first)
F. Process task (per-task approval loop)
G. Route on results
H. Create tasks in plan → invoke-task-author.md, invoke-task-writer.md
→ Route on result
```

---

## A. Cycle Gate

Crash-resume guards — read `manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging` and check in order. On a resume, `{N}` is the resumed cycle's number and `{analysis_gate_mode}` comes from the manifest's topic-level `analysis_gate_mode` (no cycle response exists to carry either).

#### If the latest `staging.c{N}` still holds a `pending` task

The cycle is mid-approval — do not record a new one.

→ Proceed to **E. Approval Overview**.

#### If the latest `staging.c{N}` holds no `pending` task and at least one `approved` and the planning file carries no `Analysis (Cycle {N})` phase

The session died between the last gate decision and the plan write — the approvals are recorded but unrealised.

→ Proceed to **H. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### If an `analysis-tasks-c{N}.md` staging file exists on disk with no matching manifest cycle

A crash between the synthesizer's write and the init — initialise the cycle from the file's task count (the batched `pending` set from **[invoke-synthesizer.md](invoke-synthesizer.md)**). Only the `analysis-tasks-` family counts: `review-tasks-c*.md`, `ad-hoc-tasks-*.md`, and `consolidation-tasks-p*.md`/`consolidation-findings-p*.md` files in the same directory belong to the review item, the ad hoc plan-changes flow, and the consolidation boundary.

→ Proceed to **E. Approval Overview**.

#### If the previous cycle's findings are committed and each records no findings

The cycle came back clean — the analysis has converged.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

#### If the previous cycle's findings are committed and its synthesis never ran

→ Proceed to **D. Dispatch Synthesis Agent** over the existing findings.

#### Otherwise

Record the cycle via the engine (increments the topic's lifetime counter):
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs task analysis-cycle {work_unit} {topic}
```

`{N}` throughout this loop refers to the response's `cycle_total`; **F. Process Task**'s `{analysis_gate_mode}` is the response's `analysis_gate_mode`.

#### If the response's `over_cycle_limit` is `false`

→ Proceed to **B. Git Checkpoint**.

#### If the response's `over_cycle_limit` is `true`

**Do NOT skip analysis autonomously.** This gate is an escape hatch for the user — not a signal to stop. The expected default is to continue running analysis until no issues are found. Present the choice and let the user decide.

Fetch and emit the `DISPLAY: cycle limit` section verbatim as a code block (a section is everything beneath its `===` marker — the marker line itself is never emitted):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render cycle-limit {work_unit}.implementation.{topic}
```

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `analysis`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, render_when = `always`.

Fetch the cycle gate and emit its `MENU: cycle gate` section verbatim as markdown (not a code block):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render cycle-gate
```

You MUST NOT choose on the user's behalf.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **B. Git Checkpoint**.

**If `skip`:**

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

---

## B. Git Checkpoint

Ensure clean code before analysis. Run `git status` and set aside every `.workflows/` path — those belong to their own phase's scope, and the loop's own commits carry them.

#### If nothing outside `.workflows/` is dirty

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

#### Otherwise

Categorize the dirty code files:

- **Implementation files** (files touched by `impl({work_unit}):` commits) — name these in the checkpoint commit automatically.
- **Unexpected files** (files not touched during implementation) — present to the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Pre-analysis checkpoint — unexpected files detected:
- {file} ({status: modified/untracked})
- ...
```

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render checkpoint-files-gate {work_unit}.implementation.{topic}
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

The checkpoint is a code commit — name the files, and the engine confines the commit to them.

**If `yes`:**

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --paths {implementation and unexpected files} -m "impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint" --for {work_unit} implementation/{topic}
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

**If `skip`:**

Name only the implementation files; the unexpected ones stay uncommitted, and come back in the response's `left_dirty`.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --paths {implementation files} -m "impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint" --for {work_unit} implementation/{topic}
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

**If comment:**

Name the implementation files plus the ones the user specified.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --paths {implementation files and the named ones} -m "impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint" --for {work_unit} implementation/{topic}
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

---

## C. Dispatch Analysis Agents

→ Load **[invoke-analysis.md](invoke-analysis.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until all agents have returned.

Commit the analysis findings — the scoped commit covers the findings files and the manifest's cycle counter:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — findings" --topic implementation/{topic}
```

#### If all three agents returned `STATUS: clean`

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **D. Dispatch Synthesis Agent**.

---

## D. Dispatch Synthesis Agent

→ Load **[invoke-synthesizer.md](invoke-synthesizer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the synthesizer has returned.

Commit the synthesis output — the scoped commit covers the report, any staging file, and the manifest's gate state:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — synthesis" --topic implementation/{topic}
```

#### If `STATUS` is `clean`

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

#### If `STATUS` is `tasks_proposed`

→ Proceed to **E. Approval Overview**.

---

## E. Approval Overview

1. **Settle the spec defects** — each `## Spec Defects` entry in `analysis-report-c{N}.md` is classified before the overview renders, so the tasks are authored against a correct specification.

   **If the report carries a `## Spec Defects` section** — once per entry:

   → Load **[correcting-historical-artifacts.md](../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** for **B. This Work Unit's Specification** and follow its instructions, with specification path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`, correcting_phase = `implementation/{topic}`.

   A record-settled entry lands there silently — a derivable gap included, its derivation in the corrigendum. A code-wrong verdict becomes a staged proposal — the tree owes the change; an open verdict (a product-intent gap, or a call the reference could not stand behind — the only classes it returns open) becomes one whose Solution says what is settled and whose **Decision** carries the question, a **Stakes** line arguing the stop (each side's product consequence, why no investigation settles the tie, and the grounds for the recommendation where a side is marked), and two to four sides, each written as the product end state chosen — what the product *is* if that side wins, never the work to do — the recommended side first and marked `(recommended)`; only an honest no-lean fork carries no marker. An entry the reference returns unsettled (the item back in its own phase, or held by another session) is left exactly as reported — never re-classified here. Add each staged verdict under the next `## Task {n}` heading in `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{N}.md` — a synthesis that staged none wrote no file: create it with its `# Analysis Tasks: {Topic} (Cycle {N})` header — shaped like the proposals beside it: a `severity:` line carrying the defect's grade (`high`, `medium`, `low` — never a refactor class), a `sources:` line naming the report entry, then **Problem**, **Solution**, and where there is one the **Decision** with its **Stakes** and sides — and initialise its row:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} pending
   ```

   An entry an earlier run already settled — its corrigendum present in the specification, or its proposal already in the staging file — is skipped; a proposal already in the staging file whose `staging.c{N}` row is missing is a crashed landing — initialise the row and move on, never re-append. When at least one correction landed — nothing when none did, never a per-correction recap — fetch and emit the `DISPLAY: spec corrections` section verbatim as a code block:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-corrections --count {count}
   ```

   **Otherwise:** nothing to settle — continue.
2. **Apply the comment corrections** — each `## Comment Corrections` entry with the Edit tool: its OLD text replaced by its NEW text at the named file, verbatim; an empty NEW deletes the comment. A correction whose NEW text is already in place was applied by an earlier run — skip it silently; one whose OLD text is otherwise absent is dropped — name the dropped ones in one line. Commit the files a correction changed as a code commit; nothing when none changed:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --paths {corrected files} -m "impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — comment corrections" --for {work_unit} implementation/{topic}
   ```

#### If the cycle stages no proposal

The synthesis staged none — the record settled every defect and the corrections are applied.

→ Proceed to **G. Route on Results**.

#### Otherwise

Read the staging file from `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{N}.md` (proposal content) and the cycle's statuses from `manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}`.

Write the overview payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/tasks-overview.json` with the Write tool (`{"label": "Analysis cycle {N}", "tasks": [{"title": "…", "severity": "…", "status": "…"}]}` — each task's `status` is its `staging.c{N}.tasks.{n}` value: `pending`, `approved`, or `skipped`), render, and emit the section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render tasks-overview {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/tasks-overview.json
```

→ Proceed to **F. Process Task**.

---

## F. Process Task

Each pass reads the next pending proposal from the staging file as it now stands — a settle may have rewritten it since the overview. `{analysis_gate_mode}` is live: `auto` from the moment the user opts in mid-cycle.

#### If no pending tasks remain

→ Proceed to **G. Route on Results**.

#### If the next pending proposal carries a Decision

→ Load **[raising-a-decision.md](../../workflow-shared/references/raising-a-decision.md)** with dotpath = `{work_unit}.implementation.{topic}`, staging_file = `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{N}.md`, payload_path = `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/proposed-task.json`, gate_mode = `{analysis_gate_mode}`, row_address = `staging.c{N}.tasks.{n}`, comment_hint = `Provide feedback to adjust`, findings_paths = the cycle's `analysis-report-c{N}.md` and the `analysis-duplication-c{N}.md`, `analysis-standards-c{N}.md` and `analysis-architecture-c{N}.md` files that exist.

→ On return, return to **F. Process Task**.

#### Otherwise

Present it plain. Write its payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/proposed-task.json` with the Write tool — `{"current": …, "total": …, "title": "…", "severity": "…", "sources": "…", "problem": "…", "solution": "…"}` from the staging proposal, adding `"outcome": "…"` when it carries one. `{gate}` is `{analysis_gate_mode}` — except a proposal whose fork a Comment on its raise settled this session, which renders `gated` whatever the mode: the settled direction interprets the user's words, so it lands with an explicit approval. Render, and emit each section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render proposed-task {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/proposed-task.json --gate {gate} --comment-hint "Provide feedback to adjust"
```

#### If the response carried `DISPLAY: task auto-approved`

Record the approval (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} approved`), then emit the section per its marker.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

#### If the response carried `MENU: task approval`

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Record the approval: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} approved`.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If `auto`:**

Record the approval: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} approved`.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} analysis_gate_mode auto
```

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If `decline`:**

Record the decline: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} skipped`.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If comment:**

Revise the staged proposal in the staging file based on the user's feedback (content only), and rewrite the payload.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

---

## G. Route on Results

#### If the manifest's `staging.c{N}.tasks` marks any task `approved`

→ Proceed to **H. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### Otherwise

Nothing is approved — the cycle's proposals were declined, or it staged none. Commit the cycle's decisions (the scoped commit covers the manifest):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — no tasks approved" --topic implementation/{topic}
```

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

---

## H. Create Tasks in Plan

The approved proposals carry no bodies — the author expands exactly those, in the staging file, before the writer transcribes them:

→ Load **[invoke-task-author.md](invoke-task-author.md)** and follow its instructions as written, with staging file path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{N}.md`, findings file paths = the cycle's `analysis-report-c{N}.md` and the `analysis-duplication-c{N}.md`, `analysis-standards-c{N}.md` and `analysis-architecture-c{N}.md` files that exist, approved task numbers = the task numbers whose `staging.c{N}` rows are `approved`.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the task author has returned.

#### If the author's `STATUS` is `failed`

Nothing was authored. State the author's reason plainly; the staging stays untouched.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If the user resolves the input:**

→ Return to **H. Create Tasks in Plan** — re-invocation is idempotent.

**If the user abandons the tasks:**

Mark each remaining `approved` row `skipped` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} skipped`).

→ Return to **G. Route on Results**.

#### Otherwise

→ Load **[invoke-task-writer.md](invoke-task-writer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the task writer has returned.

**If the planning item carries no `storage_paths`** (a plan initialised before the field existed): record it now — read the format's authoring.md → Storage Pathspecs and copy the fenced array:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} storage_paths '{format storage pathspecs}'
```

Commit the staging file with this topic's implementation artifacts, then the tasks — `--plan` stages the planning topic, the manifests, and the plan's declared storage:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — staged tasks" --topic implementation/{topic}
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "impl({work_unit}): add analysis cycle {N} — {K} task(s)" --plan {topic}
```

→ Return to caller.
