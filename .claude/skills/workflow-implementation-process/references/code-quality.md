# Code Quality

*Reference for **[workflow-implementation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Apply standard quality principles. Defer to project-specific skills for framework conventions.

## Principles

### DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Extract repeated logic after three instances (Rule of Three)
- Avoid premature abstraction for code used once or twice

### Compose, Don't Duplicate
When new behavior is the logical inverse or subset of existing behavior, derive it from the existing abstraction rather than implementing independently. If you have a query for "ready items," the query for "blocked items" should be "open AND NOT ready" — not an independently authored query that could drift. Prefer mathematical relationships (derived = total - computed) over parallel computations that must be kept in sync.

### SOLID
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function does one thing. Multi-step logic should decompose into named helper functions — each step a function, each name documents intent.
- **Open/Closed**: Extend behavior without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Don't force classes to implement unused methods
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Cyclomatic Complexity
Keep low. Fix with early returns and method extraction.

### YAGNI
Only implement what's in the plan. Ask: "Is this in the plan?"

### Concrete Over Abstract
Prefer concrete types over language-level escape hatches that bypass the type system. Use specific types for data passing between layers, not untyped containers. If you need polymorphism, define a named interface/protocol with specific methods — don't pass untyped values. If you find yourself writing runtime type checks or casts inside a function, the signature is too abstract.

## Testability
- Inject dependencies
- Prefer pure functions
- Avoid hidden dependencies

## Comments

Code shows what; a comment earns its place only by carrying what the code cannot. Before writing one, try to make it unnecessary — rename, extract, simplify — and comment what survives. No comment is checked by any compiler or test: every claim one makes is a maintenance liability, so spend them sparingly and keep each claim small.

**A comment is warranted for:**
- **Why** — rationale, a rejected alternative, a constraint imposed from elsewhere
- **Warnings** — deliberate-looking-wrong code that must not be "simplified", surprising behaviour, consequences ("not thread-safe", "order matters: the read precedes the discard"). Name the trap in a line or two
- **Opaque what** — a regex, bit trick, or dense algorithm that stays opaque after refactoring
- **Public/exported API doc comments** per the language's own conventions — what it does, inputs, outputs, error behaviour; never internal algorithm

**Never in a comment:**
- Links, URLs, issue ids, or any workflow vocabulary — task ids, phase numbers, spec-section citations. The comment must hold true for a reader with no knowledge of the process that produced the code, long after its artifacts are archived
- Claims about tests — what a test pins, catches, or proves. A renamed test or moved assertion turns the claim into a confident lie
- Cardinality claims — "the single caller", "the only site that…", "nothing consumes this yet". Falsified by ordinary additive change far from the comment
- Worked examples and hand-traced values. An example worth keeping is a test, where it executes
- The design argument. State the conclusion the code needs ("sorted before dedup — dedup keys on adjacency"), not the debate; the reasoning lives in the project's design artifacts
- Restated adjacent code, changelog narration, attribution, commented-out code

When a change makes a nearby comment false, fix it in the same edit — and prefer deleting the claim to re-arguing it.

### Comment corrections

Where an output format names a comment-correction shape, a finding whose entire remedy is comment text is reported there — the file and line, what is wrong, the OLD text verbatim, the NEW text (empty to delete) — never as a finding. A correction must itself clear the bar above: a comment earns its place only by carrying what the code cannot, and a comment that cannot is deleted, never reworded.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- God classes
- Magic numbers/strings
- Deep nesting (3+)
- Long parameter lists (4+)
- Boolean parameters
- Untyped parameters when concrete types are known at design time
- Substring assertions in tests when exact output is deterministic
