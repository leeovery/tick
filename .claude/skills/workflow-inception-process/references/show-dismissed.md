# Show Dismissed

*Reference for **[workflow-inception-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Recovery flow for the refinement session. Surfaces topic names previously removed from the map and offers re-add. Loaded by **[refinement-session.md](refinement-session.md)** when the user asks to see dismissed items.

State comes from `skills/workflow-inception-process/scripts/discovery.cjs` — invoke it via Bash and read the structured output. Never invoke the underlying Node helpers inline.

## A. Read Dismissed List

Re-run discovery to pick up any state changes since the parent's initial discovery (a Remove earlier in the session may have added a new entry):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-inception-process/scripts/discovery.cjs {work_unit}
```

Read the `dismissed` array from the output.

#### If `dismissed` is empty

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Dismissed Topics

  (none)
```

→ Return to caller.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **B. Render and Prompt**.

## B. Render and Prompt

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Dismissed Topics

@foreach(name in dismissed)
  • {name}
@endforeach
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```

Re-add any of these to the map?

- **Name them** — Tell me which to re-add (and routing if known)
- **`b`/`back`** — Return to the refinement session
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If the user names one or more dismissed items to re-add

Treat the response as an Add intent and dispatch to the Add flow:

→ Load **[map-operations.md](map-operations.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

`map-operations.md` re-runs discovery, validates each name (collision check is satisfied — dismissed-list match is allowed for Add and triggers a `pull` from the dismissed list before `init-phase`), STOP-gates on the batch, applies the writes, appends a Changes entry to the session log, and commits.

When `map-operations.md` returns:

→ Return to caller.
