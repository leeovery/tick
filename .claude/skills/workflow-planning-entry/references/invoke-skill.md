Work unit: {work_unit}

Specification: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md
Additional context: {summary of user's additional context, or "none"}
Cross-cutting references: {list of applicable cross-cutting specs with brief summaries, or "none"}
```

#### If continuing or reviewing existing plan

Invoke the **workflow-planning-process** skill (Skill tool) with the next fenced block as its arguments. Do not act on the gathered context until its instructions load — the skill defines the process.

```
Planning session for: {topic}
Work unit: {work_unit}

Specification: .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md
Existing plan: .workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md
Cross-cutting references: {list of applicable cross-cutting specs with brief summaries, or "none"}
```
