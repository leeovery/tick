# Session Loop

*Reference for **[workflow-discovery-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Follow the curatorial moves and hard rules from **[discovery-guidelines.md](discovery-guidelines.md)** throughout. No background agents, no review cycles, no perspective dispatches.

State-driven branches in **A. Open** pick the opening shape; **B. Session Loop** runs pure exploration; **C. Endpoint and Synthesis** detects the endpoint and produces the topic set. When the map already has items, edits to existing items happen in the loop alongside exploration.

## A. Open

Read `discovery_map`, `dismissed`, and `imports` from the most recent discovery output. Read `session_number` and any active file path from the resume state set at Step 0.

#### If a resume was selected at Step 0

The user chose `continue` at resume detection — the active session log on disk is the working state. Read `.workflows/{work_unit}/discovery/session-{session_number}.md` to load **Exploration**, **Edits**, and any partially-filled **Topics Identified** into context.

Brief the user with the working state and ask where to pick up:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Picking up where we left off.

  Exploration so far:
  {one-line summary of the Exploration narrative — or "no exploration yet" if empty}

  Edits applied:
  • {operation} {target}
  • ...

Where do you want to take it from here?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `discovery_map` is non-empty (map already populated)

The map exists; editing existing items is available alongside new exploration. Render the map as an anchor using the discovery output from Step 1, then open the conversation:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
●───────────────────────────────────────────────●
  Discovery — {work_unit:(titlecase)}
●───────────────────────────────────────────────●

  Discovery Map ({total} topics{tier_breakdown})

@foreach(topic in discovery_map)
  {branch} {topic.tier} {topic.name:(titlecase)} [{lifecycle_label}]
@endforeach
```

Render rules:

- `tier_breakdown` — append ` — {decided} decided · {in_flight} in flight · {ready} ready · {fresh} fresh · {cancelled} cancelled` (omitting zero-count categories) only when more than one tier bucket is non-zero. When only one bucket is non-zero, omit the breakdown and render just `Discovery Map ({total} topics)`.
- `{branch}` — `┌─` for the first row, `└─` for the last, `├─` for the rest. With a single row, use `└─` (no upward stroke).
- Tier ordering — discovery output is already tier-sorted (`→ ◐ ✓ ○ ⊘`, alphabetical within tier). Render in the order given.
- `lifecycle_label` by tier (wrapped in square brackets per the row template):
  - `→` — `research complete · ready for discussion`
  - `◐` — `researching` or `discussing` (use `topic.current_phase`)
  - `✓` — `decided`
  - `○` — `fresh · routed to {topic.routing}` (omit ` · routed to ...` if `topic.routing` is null)
  - `⊘` — `cancelled`

Then frame the opener:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
You can open a fresh thread — a new area of the work you want
to sketch out — and we'll explore it the same way we did first
time, then synthesise topics at the end. Or you can name changes
to existing items: add, remove, rename, re-route, edit summary,
edit description. Both in one go is fine.

Say "show map" anytime to pull the map back up.

What's on your mind for this map?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `discovery_map` is empty and imports exist

Fresh first-session with seed material. Read each file listed under `imports[]` (paths are relative to `.workflows/{work_unit}/`). Use the import content as the conversation launchpad: reflect what's actually in the seed material, ask exploratory questions about what's there. Don't dump the imports back at the user verbatim — synthesise.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Read your import(s). Here's the shape I'm picking up:

  {one-line summary of what the imports describe}

Before we name topics, let's pull on a few things — {one or two
exploratory questions drawn from the seed material}.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

#### Otherwise

Fresh first-session, no map, no imports. The work-unit description has been read silently — don't narrate or summarise it back. Open with this prompt:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Tell me about what you want to build. Don't worry about
structure — describe it the way it sits in your head right now.

I'll ask some open questions to pull on the idea before we
synthesise topics.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

→ Proceed to **B. Session Loop**.

## B. Session Loop

No fixed cadence — follow the conversation, not a checklist. **The loop is pure exploration.** Topics are synthesised at endpoint in **C**.

1. **Listen.** Take in what the user just said.
2. **Recognise intent.** The user's message may contain:
   - **Exploration content** — answers to your questions, new surfaces, descriptions of how parts work or connect. Continue the conversation: ask the next exploratory question, follow the thread the user opened. See [discovery-guidelines.md](discovery-guidelines.md) → *Open Exploration — How* for what to ask and where to push.
   - **An edit operation on an existing map item** — *"remove X"*, *"rename X to Y"*, *"edit summary of X"*, etc. Only possible when the map is non-empty. Delegate to [map-operations.md](map-operations.md) — it handles the operation, writes to the **Edits** section, commits.
   - **A request to see the map** — *"show map"*, *"what's on the map"*. Re-render using the opener's render rules. No STOP gate; just render and continue.
   - **A request to see dismissed items** — *"show dismissed"*, *"what was removed"*. Load [show-dismissed.md](show-dismissed.md).
   - **A KB query for prior context** — when a conversational thread would benefit from prior work on this or sibling work units, invoke `knowledge query` with a query derived from the thread (see [contextual-query.md](../../workflow-knowledge/references/contextual-query.md) for the pattern).
   - **An endpoint signal** — *"that covers it"*, *"good enough to start"*, *"let's wrap"*, *"done"*, *"ready to go"*. Route to **C. Endpoint and Synthesis**.

3. **Continue the exploration.** Ask one question at a time. Follow the conversation. See *Mirroring, not challenging* in the guidelines.

4. **Watch for natural endpoint patterns** — Claude-side observations that the picture has been adequately mapped:
   - The conversation circles back to surfaces already covered
   - Several turns produce only confirmation of existing surfaces, no new ground
   - The shape feels mapped to you and to the user

   When you observe these patterns, route to **C. Endpoint and Synthesis** — *propose* endpoint, don't *declare* it. The user confirms or extends.

5. **Document at natural pauses.** Write a strong-summary entry to the **Exploration** section of the session log at:
   - A surface has been adequately explored — capture what was covered
   - Conversation is about to branch to a new area — close out the current thread
   - Context-compaction risk feels real (long conversation, lots of detail accumulating)

   The Exploration entry is **prose, not transcript** — capture what was named, what crystallised, what was decided not to pursue. The log survives context refresh; in-context memory does not.

   The lazy-creation rule applies: this may create the session log file if it doesn't exist yet — see [template.md](template.md) → *Lazy creation and finalisation*. After writing, set the active-session marker (idempotent) and commit:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {work_unit}.discovery active_session "{session_number:03d}"
   git add -- .workflows/{work_unit}/
   git commit -m "discovery({work_unit}): exploration notes — session-{session_number:03d}"
   ```

→ Proceed to **C. Endpoint and Synthesis** when either an endpoint signal is recognised in step 2 or a natural endpoint pattern is observed in step 4. Otherwise loop within **B**.

## C. Endpoint and Synthesis

Reached from B when an endpoint signal arrives from the user or Claude observes natural endpoint patterns.

**Propose endpoint with optional pushback.** First, a one-line read of what got covered, plus zero, one, or two pushback angles if any genuinely unexplored ground comes to mind:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Feels like we've sketched the shape — {one-line read of what got covered}.

{Optional pushback — one or two angles not yet pulled on. Examples:}
- We didn't talk about how X handles Y — worth a moment?
- Did you want to map Z, or is that scope for later?
```

Pushback is **optional and bounded**. If nothing genuinely unexplored comes to mind, skip the pushback lines entirely. Don't fabricate angles to look thorough.

Then prompt the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```

Ready to synthesise topics?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Synthesise topics now
- **Keep going** — Tell me what else to explore
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Load **[topic-synthesis.md](topic-synthesis.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

When `topic-synthesis.md` returns:

→ Return to caller.

#### If keep going

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.
