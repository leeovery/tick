Continue Bugfix

{count} bugfix(es) in progress:

@foreach(bugfix in bugfixes)
  {N}. {bugfix.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ {bugfix.phase_label:(titlecase)}

@endforeach

@if(completed_count > 0 || cancelled_count > 0)
{completed_count} completed, {cancelled_count} cancelled.
@endif
```

Build from the discovery output's `bugfixes` array. Each bugfix shows `name` (titlecased) and `phase_label` (titlecased). Blank line between each numbered item.

Recreate with actual bugfixes and `phase_label` values from discovery. No auto-select, even with one item.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose a bugfix number

Store the selected bugfix's name as `work_unit`.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.

#### If user chose "View completed & cancelled"

→ Load **[../../workflow-start/references/view-completed.md](../../workflow-start/references/view-completed.md)** with work_type filter = `bugfix`. On return, re-run discovery and redisplay from the top of this reference.

#### If user chose `m`/`manage`

→ Load **[../../workflow-start/references/manage-work-unit.md](../../workflow-start/references/manage-work-unit.md)**. On return, re-run discovery and redisplay from the top of this reference.
