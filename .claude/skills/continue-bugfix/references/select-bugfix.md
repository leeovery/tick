{count} bugfix(es) in progress:

@foreach(bugfix in bugfixes)
  {N}. {bugfix.name:(titlecase)}
     └─ {bugfix.phase_label:(titlecase)}

@endforeach

@if(completed_count > 0 || cancelled_count > 0)
{completed_count} completed, {cancelled_count} cancelled.
@endif
```

Build from the discovery output's `bugfixes` array. Each bugfix shows `name` (titlecased) and `phase_label` (titlecased). Blank line between each numbered item.
