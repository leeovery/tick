---

Continue an in-progress bugfix. Determines current phase and routes to the appropriate phase skill.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

---

## Step 0: Initialisation

Load **[casing-conventions.md](../workflow-shared/references/casing-conventions.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

**Run migrations — this is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Invoke the `/workflow-migrate` skill and follow its instructions exactly — if it issues a STOP gate, you must stop.

---

## Step 1: Discovery State

!`node .claude/skills/continue-bugfix/scripts/discovery.js`

If the above shows a script invocation rather than discovery output, the dynamic content preprocessor did not run. Execute the script before continuing:

```bash
node .claude/skills/continue-bugfix/scripts/discovery.js
```

If discovery output is already displayed, it has been run on your behalf.

Parse the discovery output to understand:

**From `bugfixes` array:**
- `name` - the work unit name
- `next_phase` - the phase to route to
- `phase_label` - human-readable phase status
- `completed_phases` - list of completed phases (for backwards navigation)

**From top-level fields:**
- `count` - number of active bugfixes
- `summary` - human-readable state summary
- `completed` / `cancelled` - arrays of non-active bugfixes with name, status, last_phase
- `completed_count` / `cancelled_count` - counts for each

**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY this script for discovery. Do NOT run additional bash commands (ls, head, cat, etc.) to gather state.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Check Count and Arguments

#### If `count` is 0

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Continue Bugfix

No bugfixes in progress.

Run /start-bugfix to begin a new one.
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

#### If `work_unit` argument `$0` provided

Store the work_unit.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

#### If `work_unit` not provided

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Select Bugfix

Load **[select-bugfix.md](references/select-bugfix.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Validate Selection

Load **[validate-selection.md](references/validate-selection.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Backwards Navigation

Load **[revisit-phase.md](references/revisit-phase.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Route to Phase Skill

Using the selected bugfix's `next_phase`, invoke the appropriate phase skill:

| next_phase | Invoke |
|------------|--------|
| investigation | `/workflow-investigation-entry bugfix {work_unit}` |
| specification | `/workflow-specification-entry bugfix {work_unit}` |
| planning | `/workflow-planning-entry bugfix {work_unit}` |
| implementation | `/workflow-implementation-entry bugfix {work_unit}` |
| review | `/workflow-review-entry bugfix {work_unit}` |

Skills receive positional arguments: `$0` = work_type (`bugfix`), `$1` = work_unit. Topic is inferred from work_unit.

If the user chose to revisit a completed phase in Step 5, use that phase instead of `next_phase`.

Invoke the skill. This is terminal — do not return to the backbone.
