Specification Overview

{N} concluded discussions found. No specifications exist yet.

Concluded discussions:

### Cache-Aware Message

No `---` separator before these messages.

#### If cache status is "none"

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

These discussions will be analyzed for natural groupings to determine
how they should be organized into specifications. Results are cached
and reused until discussions change.
```
