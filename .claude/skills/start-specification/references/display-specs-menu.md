# Display: Specs Menu

*Reference for **[start-specification](../SKILL.md)***

---

Shows when multiple concluded discussions exist, specifications exist, and cache is none or stale. Displays existing specs from discovery frontmatter (NOT from cache), lists unassigned discussions, and offers analysis or continue options.

## A. Display

```
Specification Overview

{N} concluded discussions found. {M} specifications exist.

Existing specifications:
```

For each non-superseded specification from discovery output, display as nested tree:

```
1. {Spec Title Case Name}
   └─ Spec: {status} ({X} of {Y} sources extracted)
   └─ Discussions:
      ├─ {source-name} (extracted)
      └─ {source-name} (extracted)
```

**Formatting is exact**: Output the tree structure exactly as shown above — preserve all indentation spaces and `├─`/`└─` characters. Do not flatten or compress the spacing.

Determine discussion status from the spec's `sources` array:
- `incorporated` + `discussion_status: concluded` or `not-found` → `extracted`
- `incorporated` + `discussion_status: other` (e.g. `in-progress`) → `extracted, reopened`
- `pending` → `pending`

Extraction count: X = sources with `status: incorporated`, Y = total source count from the spec's `sources` array.

### Unassigned Discussions

List concluded discussions that are not in any specification's `sources` array:

```
Concluded discussions not in a specification:
  • {discussion-name}
  • {discussion-name}
```

### If in-progress discussions exist

```
Discussions not ready for specification:
These discussions are still in progress and must be concluded
before they can be included in a specification.
  · {discussion-name} (in-progress)
```

### Key/Legend

Show only the statuses that appear in the current display. No `---` separator before this section.

```
Key:

  Discussion status:
    extracted — content has been incorporated into the specification
    reopened  — was extracted but discussion has regressed to in-progress

  Spec status:
    in-progress — specification work is ongoing
    concluded   — specification is complete
```

### Cache-Aware Message

No `---` separator before these messages.

#### If cache status is "none"

```
No grouping analysis exists.
```

#### If cache status is "stale"

```
A previous grouping analysis exists but is outdated — discussions
have changed since it was created. Re-analysis is required.
```

→ Proceed to **B. Menu**.

## B. Menu

List "Analyze for groupings (recommended)" first, then one entry per existing non-superseded specification. The verb depends on the spec's state:

- Spec is `in-progress` → **Continue** "{Name}" — in-progress
- Spec is `concluded` with pending sources → **Continue** "{Name}" — {N} source(s) pending extraction
- Spec is `concluded` with no pending sources → **Refine** "{Name}" — concluded

**Example assembled menu** (2 specs exist):

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
1. Analyze for groupings (recommended)
   `All discussions are analyzed for natural groupings. Existing`
   `specification names are preserved. You can provide guidance`
   `in the next step.`
2. Continue "Auth Flow" — in-progress
3. Refine "Data Model" — concluded

Select an option (enter number):
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

Menu descriptions are wrapped in backticks to visually distinguish them from the choice labels.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user picks "Analyze for groupings"

If cache is stale, delete it first:
```bash
rm docs/workflow/.cache/discussion-consolidation-analysis.md
```

→ Load **[analysis-flow.md](analysis-flow.md)** and follow its instructions.

#### If user picks "Continue" or "Refine" for a spec

The selected spec and its sources become the context for confirmation.

→ Load **[confirm-and-handoff.md](confirm-and-handoff.md)** and follow its instructions.
