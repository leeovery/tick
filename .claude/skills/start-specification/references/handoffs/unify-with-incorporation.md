```
Specification session for: Unified

Source discussions:
- docs/workflow/discussion/{discussion-name}.md
- docs/workflow/discussion/{discussion-name}.md
...

Existing specifications to incorporate:
- docs/workflow/specification/{spec-name}.md
- docs/workflow/specification/{spec-name}.md

Output: docs/workflow/specification/unified.md

Context: This consolidates all discussions into a single unified specification. The existing specifications should be incorporated - extract and adapt their content alongside the discussion material.

After the unified specification is complete, mark the incorporated specs as superseded by updating their frontmatter:

    status: superseded
    superseded_by: unified
