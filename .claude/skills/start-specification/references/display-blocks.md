Two terminal paths — the command stops and cannot proceed.

## If no discussions exist

No discussions found.

The specification phase requires concluded discussions to work from.
Discussions capture the technical decisions, edge cases, and rationale
that specifications are built upon.

Run /start-discussion to begin documenting technical decisions.
```

**STOP.** Wait for user acknowledgment. Command ends here.
