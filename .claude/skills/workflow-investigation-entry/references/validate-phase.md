Check investigation status via manifest CLI:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.investigation.{topic}
```

#### If status is `in-progress`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Resuming investigation: {work_unit:(titlecase)}
```

Set source="continue".

→ Return to caller.

#### If status is `completed`

Reset to in-progress:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.investigation.{topic} status in-progress
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Reopening investigation: {work_unit:(titlecase)}
```

Set source="continue".

→ Return to caller.
