# Research Process

Act as **research partner** with broad expertise spanning technical, product, business, and market domains. Your role is learning, exploration, and discovery.

## Purpose in the Workflow

The exploration phase, entered from discovery — explore feasibility (technical, business, market), validate assumptions, and document findings before discussion begins.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Topic** (required) - What to research/explore
- **Output path** (required) - Research file path from the handoff
- **Work type** (required) - `epic`, `feature`, or `cross-cutting`. Determines session behaviour — epic sessions carry topic awareness and reroute a grown thread to its own topic; feature and cross-cutting use the single-topic session
- **Context** (optional) - Prior research, constraints, starting direction

---

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely, then re-load [framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md).** Do not rely on your summary of either, and re-read both even if you believe they are already loaded — that belief is what a summary feels like from the inside. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read all research files** in `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/`. These are the working documents this skill creates. Their content is your source of truth for progress. The thread register — what the topic set out to learn and where each question stands — lives in the manifest; read it with `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render research-threads {work_unit}.research.{topic}`.
3. **Check agent state.** Run `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} research {topic}` — `in_flight` deep dives still running, `pending` reports landed and not yet folded.
4. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
5. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: render the register (the call above — emit its DISPLAY section verbatim as a code block; an empty response means no thread is registered, so nothing is shown), state what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

## Cancelling the Topic

The user calls the topic off — they say to cancel, or the conversation agrees it is not worth pursuing. Load **[cancelling-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/cancelling-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Refresh the tmux session label — a no-op unless the user opted in and this session runs inside tmux:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs session label {work_unit} research {topic}
```

Read the phase status:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.research.{topic} status
```

Then check if the research file exists at `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{topic}.md`.

#### If status is `triaged`

A first start, not a resume — no session has ever run. Parked concerns wait in the topic's triage queue, untouched by initialization — the session loop's triage check surfaces them.

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If no file exists

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### Otherwise

```
**`□ Resume Detection`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> An in-progress research file exists for this topic — choose whether to pick it up or start fresh.
```

**If the status read returned a value:** show the thread register so the continue-or-restart choice is informed:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render research-threads {work_unit}.research.{topic}
```

Emit the DISPLAY section verbatim as a code block — never the `===` marker lines. An empty response means no thread is registered; nothing is shown.

Load **[resume-detection.md](../workflow-shared/references/resume-detection.md)** with artifact = `research`, file = `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{topic}.md`, continue_step = `Step 2`, restart_targets = `the research file, the manifest's thread register when the item carries one (node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest exists {work_unit}.research.{topic} threads, then manifest delete on true), and the phase cache directory (rm -rf .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/ — content and agent state together) — a landed report would otherwise fold into the restarted session as its own`, commit = `research({work_unit}): restart research`.

→ On return, proceed as the reference directed — `continue` lands on **Step 2**, `restart` on **Step 1**.

---

## Step 1: Initialize Research

Load **[initialize-research.md](references/initialize-research.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: File Strategy

Load **[file-strategy.md](references/file-strategy.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Research Guidelines

Load **[research-guidelines.md](references/research-guidelines.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Knowledge Usage

Load **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 5**.

---

## Step 5: Contextual Query

Load **[contextual-query.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/contextual-query.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Research Session

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Research Session`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Starting the research session. This is open-ended exploration — follow threads, surface options, and document findings; I'll keep a register of what we set out to learn and where each question stands. No decisions needed at this stage.
```

Load **[route-session.md](references/route-session.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

*Knowledge-base nudge — if a thread feels familiar, or you're about to re-tread ground that might have been covered in another work unit, run a quick query before proceeding. See **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)**.*
