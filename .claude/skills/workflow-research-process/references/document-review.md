# Document Review

*Reference for **[workflow-research-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

This check catches *conversational* gaps — substance that was discussed in the session but never made it into the research file. Only the main orchestrator can do this: you were in the conversation, a sub-agent wasn't.

## A. Re-Read the Research Document

Read the research document(s) in full:

- Feature: `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{topic}.md`
- Epic: all files in `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/` relevant to the current topic

Pull the current state fresh into context — don't rely on your memory of what you wrote earlier.

→ Proceed to **B. Compare and Reconcile**.

## B. Compare and Reconcile

Walk the conversation against the document and check six dimensions (the last two sweep the document alone):

1. **Undocumented substance** — threads, insights, constraints, open questions, tradeoffs, or preliminary positions that came up in conversation but never made it into the document. Not verbatim — the *substance* of what was explored. This is the most common failure mode as sessions grow long and later exchanges crowd out earlier ones.

2. **Hallucinated or embellished content** — claims in the document that don't trace back to anything actually discussed. Synthesis that drifted from what was said into what you *think* should have been said. Numbers, names, specifics that weren't in the conversation.

3. **Accuracy drift** — positions documented as firmer than they were, tentative leans written as decisions, softened user views, tradeoffs reframed beyond what the conversation supported, or context omitted that changes how a position should read.

4. **Misdirected knowledge** (epics only) — prose addressed to another topic instead of recording this topic's own ground: notes to carry forward ("→ {topic}: …"), findings owed to a sibling, "tell {topic} about X" asides, wherever they sit. A citation of a sibling's conclusions as context is fine — only knowledge *owed to* another document qualifies, and owed means the note makes an **ask** of the target: a question to explore, a defect in its own ground, substance it owns. A conclusion that answers a question a sibling deferred or triaged to this topic owes nothing back — the sibling's deferral is its forward pointer and its stale prose ages out. A `Sibling check:` line that concluded nothing is owed is settled — never re-litigated here. The sanctioned path for these is the session's own reroute at the moment the finding is known; anything found here is a miss to repair, not a convention to preserve.

5. **Pipeline meta** — the document stating its own pipeline position: notes that the research is complete or ready for discussion — whether written this session or in an earlier session. The manifest carries that state.

6. **Unverified claims** — every load-bearing empirical claim about the codebase or toolchain, whatever session wrote it. Re-run its recorded command; construct the obvious measurement where none is recorded, and record it with the result — the command alone in its span so it re-runs by copy: `` `cmd` `` → result. The documents' own figures, and anything asserted as verified earlier, are claims — not measurements. A load-bearing claim no command can check is softened to observation.

**Apply the reconciliation.** For each finding:

- Gap → add the missing substance to the research file at the appropriate place
- Hallucination → remove or correct to match what was discussed
- Drift → rewrite to faithfully reflect the conversation
- Misdirected knowledge → set aside for **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge** — never silently deleted, never landed without the gate
- Pipeline meta → remove it — fold any genuine substance it carries into the research file at the appropriate place, never the status itself
- False claim → correct to the measured value, recording the command, and repair citing prose — except where the corrected value undermines a conclusion the document draws: hold that one for the raise below, never patched silently

Commit the changes (`engine commit {work_unit} --topic research/{topic} -m "..."`) with a descriptive message (e.g., `docs(research): capture undocumented tradeoff thread`, `docs(research): correct drift on storage preference`).

#### If a corrected value undermines a conclusion the document draws

Put the measurement to the user — what the document asserts, the command and its result, and which conclusion leans on it. What the conclusion means under the true value is theirs to re-weigh.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Land their answer in the affected passages — the measured value and its command recorded either way — and commit.

→ Proceed to **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge**.

## C. Route Misdirected Knowledge

#### If the work type is not `epic`

Single-topic work has no sibling to route to. Surface each note now, one sentence apiece — what it says and which work unit it points at; the prose stays where it is and the user decides what to do with it.

→ Proceed to **D. Brief the User**.

#### If no unhandled note remains

Every note set aside in **B** has been gated (or none existed). When any reroute record was written, commit it — each landing already committed itself:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} --topic research/{topic} -m "research({work_unit}/{topic}): document review — reroute carry-notes via triage"
```

→ Proceed to **D. Brief the User**.

#### Otherwise

Take the next unhandled note. Handled-ness lives in the walk and is recoverable from the document itself: a landed note reads as a reroute record, a kept note stays as prose — so a re-run after a context refresh re-presents kept notes, which costs a repeat ask, never a silent loss. A note addressed to *this* topic is not a reroute — treat it as undocumented substance: fold it into the document, no gate.

Judge the target topic from the note's own addressing, and `landing_phase` per **Judging the Landing Phase** in **[triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)**. Write the payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/carry-note.json` with the Write tool — `{"note": [the note's lines, quoted], "target": "{target}", "landing_phase": "{landing_phase}"}` — then fetch the gate, emitting each section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render carry-note-gate {work_unit}.research.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/carry-note.json
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Build the concern from the note *plus* the session context it stems from — the finding, the reasoning, what the target needs to know — the target resolves it from cold.

→ Load **[triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, target = `{target}`, concern = `{the note's full context}`, origin = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, landing_phase = `{landing_phase}`, date = `{today}`.

On return: if `result` is `landed`, the note is handled — replace the stranded prose with a reroute record in place, `Rerouted to {landed_topic} triage ({date}).`, and when the landing response carried `reconcile_flagged` or `sources_staled`, tell the user what it flagged — the target's discussion, live or decided (research landing) or the specification(s) named in `sources_staled` (discussion landing, their extraction now stale). If `result` is `cancelled`, nothing was written — the note stays unhandled and re-presents; dropping it for good is the `skip` arm's job.

→ Return to **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge**.

**If `skip`:**

The note is handled — the prose stands as written, by the user's choice.

→ Return to **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge**.

**If comment:**

Adjust the target, landing phase, or concern content per the user's feedback; the note stays unhandled and re-presents.

→ Return to **C. Route Misdirected Knowledge**.

## D. Brief the User

#### If changes were made

Summarise conversationally — do not dump a diff. One short paragraph or a handful of bullets describing what was added, removed, or corrected and why.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Document review complete. {N} gap(s) captured, {M} correction(s) applied. Proceeding to the final compliance check.
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If the document is complete and accurate

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Document review — research file reflects the session. No changes needed.
```

→ Return to caller.
