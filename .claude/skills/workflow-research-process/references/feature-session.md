# Feature Research Session

*Reference for **[workflow-research-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

## A. Background Agents

One kind of background agent operates during research — the deep dive — and the topic's triage queue surfaces through a protocol file. Load their instructions now — they run at the appropriate moments during the session loop.

→ Load **[deep-dive-agent.md](deep-dive-agent.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Load **[rerouted-concerns.md](../../workflow-shared/references/rerouted-concerns.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research` — a protocol, not a step: the session loop's triage check enters its **A. Check**; nothing runs at load time.

---

## B. Session Loop

Focused, single-topic session — one research file; off-topic concerns route through **E. Off-Topic Concerns**.

→ Load **[session-loop.md](session-loop.md)** and follow its conversation process.

---

## C. Session Conclusion

#### If the user's sign-off leaves the topic open

Stepping away for the day, picking it up next time — a pause, not a done-signal. Commit what the exchange left and end the turn.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If the topic feels well-explored or the user indicates the topic is done

→ Proceed to **D. In-Flight Dive Handling**.

---

## D. In-Flight Dive Handling

Before concluding, check for in-flight deep dives — run `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} research {topic}` and read the response's `in_flight` list (dives dispatched but not yet returned). A dive an earlier session dispatched cannot still be running — each row's `created` timestamp tells you which those are; enter **C. Land and Fold** in **[deep-dive-agent.md](deep-dive-agent.md)** first — it closes the dead rows and folds what landed — then re-scan and count this session's `in_flight` rows alone.

#### If a fold ended on a question to the user

The conversation has the turn; the next done-signal re-enters here.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If no dive is in flight

→ Load **[topic-completion.md](topic-completion.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If dives are still running

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render in-flight-agents-gate {work_unit}.research.{topic} --count {N}
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `wait`:**

Watch for `agent scan` to promote each in-flight row to `pending`. When none remain in flight, fold each per **C. Land and Fold** in **[deep-dive-agent.md](deep-dive-agent.md)** — phase conclusion is the natural break.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Load **[topic-completion.md](topic-completion.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

## E. Off-Topic Concerns

When a concern surfaces that's beyond this topic's scope, a single-topic work type has no other topic to route it to.

Write the offer payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/off-topic-offer.json` with the Write tool (`{"concern": "…"}` — the concern's short title), then render it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render off-topic-offer {work_unit}.research.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/off-topic-offer.json
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker. The pivot option is offered only for a feature — the surface derives that from the work type.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `log`:**

Capture the concern via the `workflow-log-idea` skill so it lands in the inbox for later triage.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `pivot`:**

1. Load **[pivot-to-epic.md](../../workflow-shared/references/pivot-to-epic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`. The work unit is now an epic (conversion committed) with this topic on its discovery map.

2. From the context you already have, derive two values: `proposed_name` — a kebab-case topic name for the concern; and `concern` — the concern with the full context discussed about it.

3. Judge `landing_phase` per **Judging the Landing Phase**, then load **[triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, target = `{proposed_name}`, concern = `{concern}`, origin = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, landing_phase = `{landing_phase}`, date = `{today}`. It validates the name against the map and, on a clash, prompts to pick another or cancel. If `result` is `cancelled`, the topic wasn't created — note the concern in the research file so it isn't lost; otherwise the concern landed as the `{landed_topic}` topic and the delivery committed itself.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> This work is now an epic — continuing here with the current topic. The concern is preserved for its own handling later.
```

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `ignore`:**

Note the concern in the research file for the user to consider separately, and continue.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

## F. The Experiment Offer

When a number is about to bear a decision — a controlled measurement would settle a choice the conversation is weighing, not merely inform it — offer the laboratory. Hands-on sightings short of that bar stay in the session, labelled exploratory.

→ Load **[experiment-spawn.md](../../workflow-shared/references/experiment-spawn.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research`.

→ On return, proceed as the reference directed.
