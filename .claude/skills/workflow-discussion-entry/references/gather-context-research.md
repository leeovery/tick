Do you have anything to add? Extra context, files, or additional
research you'd like to include — drop them in now.

- **`n`/`no`** — Continue as-is
- **Add context** — Describe what you'd like to include

```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `no`

No additional context. Proceed with research sources only.

→ Return to caller.

#### If user provides additional context

Remember the additional context — it will be included alongside the research sources in the handoff to the processing skill.

→ Return to caller.
