# Gather Context

*Reference for **[workflow-discussion-entry](../SKILL.md)***

---

Route based on the `source` variable set in earlier steps.

#### If source is `new`

New discussion entry: topic was provided by the caller.

Check research status via manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit} --phase research status
```

**If research status is `concluded`:**

Read `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/*.md` for context to include in the handoff.
