# Review Actions Loop

*Reference for **[workflow-review-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

After the review is presented, this loop closes the phase: a pass completes it, and a fail turns the replan findings into tasks and reopens implementation. Every arm that ends the review ends it through **[close-review.md](close-review.md)** — the one exit, so nothing the close owes can be missed.

Stages A through G run sequentially. Always start at **A. Verdict Gate**.

```
A. Verdict gate (pass completes; fail proceeds to synthesis)
B. Dispatch review synthesizer → invoke-review-synthesizer.md
C. Approval overview (spec defects settled first)
D. Process task (per-task approval loop)
E. Route on results
F. Create tasks in plan → invoke-task-author.md, invoke-review-task-writer.md
G. Re-open implementation + plan mode handoff
```

---

## A. Verdict Gate

Read the verdict — arms in order, the resume guard first (on a resume a verdict arm also matches; the guard wins).

#### If a prior session's staging cycle is still mid-flight

Read `manifest get {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging` — `{N}` is the latest cycle present there; with no cycle in `staging`, only the file-with-no-cycle clause can hold. Mid-flight means any of: a cycle's `tasks` still hold a `pending` row; the latest cycle has approvals but the planning file carries no `Review Remediation (Cycle {N})` phase; that phase exists and none of its task ids appear in `{work_unit}.implementation.{topic}` `completed_tasks` (the re-open never ran); or a `review-tasks-c*.md` file exists in `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/` with no matching manifest cycle. The synthesis decision was already made — do not re-ask; **B**'s guards resume it precisely.

→ Proceed to **B. Dispatch Review Synthesizer**.

#### If the verdict is `Pass`

The user chose `c/complete` at the review gate.

→ Load **[close-review.md](close-review.md)** with completion_message = `review({work_unit}): complete review phase`, staging_commit = `none`.

#### If the verdict is `Fail`

The user chose `p/plan` at the review gate — the choice is made; never re-ask. The `replan` actions in `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/actions.json` become tasks, and implementation reopens to build them.

→ Proceed to **B. Dispatch Review Synthesizer**.

---

## B. Dispatch Review Synthesizer

Crash-resume guards — read `manifest get {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging` and check in order. On a resume, `{N}` is the resumed cycle's number and its file is `review-tasks-c{N}.md`. "The latest cycle" always means the latest cycle present in `staging` — with none there, only the file-with-no-cycle guard can hold.

#### If a staging cycle's `tasks` still hold a `pending` row

The cycle is mid-approval — do not re-dispatch. Its `staging.c{N}` subtree carries `gate_mode` and the per-task decisions.

→ Proceed to **C. Approval Overview**.

#### If the latest cycle holds no `pending` row and at least one `approved` and the planning file carries no `Review Remediation (Cycle {N})` phase

The session died between the last gate decision and the plan write — the approvals are recorded but unrealised.

→ Proceed to **F. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### If a `review-tasks-c{N}.md` staging file exists on disk with no matching manifest cycle

A crash between the synthesizer's write and the init — initialise the cycle now from the file's task count (the batched `pending` set from **[invoke-review-synthesizer.md](invoke-review-synthesizer.md)**). Only the `review-tasks-` family counts: `analysis-tasks-c*.md`, `ad-hoc-tasks-*.md`, and `consolidation-tasks-p*.md`/`consolidation-findings-p*.md` files in the same directory belong to the implementation item, the ad hoc plan-changes flow, and the consolidation boundary.

→ Proceed to **C. Approval Overview**.

#### If the latest cycle's remediation phase is in the plan and none of its tasks are in `completed_tasks`

The session died between **F**'s plan write and **G**'s re-open (task ids land in `completed_tasks` when the re-opened implementation runs them, declines included). Re-enter **F** — the task writer is idempotent and completes any partial `task_map`, and its commit picks up whatever the crash left unstaged.

→ Proceed to **F. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### Otherwise

→ Load **[invoke-review-synthesizer.md](invoke-review-synthesizer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the synthesizer has returned.

#### If `STATUS` is `clean`

No actionable tasks from synthesis.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
No actionable tasks synthesized — closing the review.
```

→ Load **[close-review.md](close-review.md)** with completion_message = `review({work_unit}): complete review phase`, staging_commit = `none`.

#### If `STATUS` is `tasks_proposed`

→ Proceed to **C. Approval Overview**.

---

## C. Approval Overview

Settle the spec defects first — each `## Spec Defects` entry in `review-report-c{N}.md` is classified before the overview renders, so the tasks are authored against a correct specification. Once per entry:

→ Load **[correcting-historical-artifacts.md](../../workflow-shared/references/correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** for **B. This Work Unit's Specification** and follow its instructions, with specification path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`, correcting_phase = `review/{topic}`.

A record-settled entry lands there silently — a derivable gap included, its derivation in the corrigendum. A code-wrong verdict becomes a staged proposal — the tree owes the change; an open verdict (a product-intent gap, or a call the reference could not stand behind — the only classes it returns open) becomes one whose Solution says what is settled and whose **Decision** carries the question, a **Stakes** line arguing the stop (each side's product consequence, why no investigation settles the tie, and the grounds for the recommendation where a side is marked), and two to four sides, each written as the product end state chosen — what the product *is* if that side wins, never the work to do — the recommended side first and marked `(recommended)`; only an honest no-lean fork carries no marker. An entry the reference returns unsettled (the item back in its own phase, or held by another session) is left exactly as reported — never re-classified here. Add each staged verdict under the next `## Task {n}` heading in `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md` — a synthesis that staged none wrote no file: create it with its `# Review Tasks: {topic:(titlecase)} (Cycle {N})` header — shaped like the proposals beside it: a `severity:` line carrying the defect's grade (`high`, `medium`, `low` — never a refactor class), a `sources:` line naming the report entry, then **Problem**, **Solution**, and where there is one the **Decision** with its **Stakes** and sides — and initialise its row:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} pending
```

An entry an earlier run already settled — its corrigendum present in the specification, or its proposal already in the staging file — is skipped; a proposal already in the staging file whose `staging.c{N}` row is missing is a crashed landing — initialise the row and move on, never re-append. When at least one correction landed — nothing when none did, never a per-correction recap — fetch and emit the `DISPLAY: spec corrections` section verbatim as a code block:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render spec-corrections --count {count}
```

#### If the cycle stages no proposal

The synthesis staged none and the record settled every defect.

→ Proceed to **E. Route on Results**.

#### Otherwise

Read the staging file from `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md` (proposal content) and the cycle's state from `manifest get {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}` (statuses + `gate_mode`).

Write the overview payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/tasks-overview.json` with the Write tool (`{"label": "Review synthesis cycle {N}", "tasks": [{"title": "…", "severity": "…", "status": "…"}]}` — each task's `status` is its `staging.c{N}.tasks.{n}` value: `pending`, `approved`, or `skipped`), render, and emit the section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render tasks-overview {work_unit}.review.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/tasks-overview.json
```

→ Proceed to **D. Process Task**.

---

## D. Process Task

Each pass reads the next pending proposal from the staging file as it now stands — a settle may have rewritten it since the overview — and `{gate_mode}` fresh from the manifest's `staging.c{N}` subtree: the auto arm may have set it this walk.

#### If no pending tasks remain

→ Proceed to **E. Route on Results**.

#### If the next pending proposal carries a Decision

→ Load **[raising-a-decision.md](../../workflow-shared/references/raising-a-decision.md)** with dotpath = `{work_unit}.review.{topic}`, staging_file = `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md`, payload_path = `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/proposed-task.json`, gate_mode = `{gate_mode}`, row_address = `staging.c{N}.tasks.{n}`, comment_hint = `Tell me what to change`, findings_paths = the cycle's `review-report-c{N}.md`, the per-task `report-*.md` files and the `change-set-c{N}-*.md` files in `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/`.

→ On return, return to **D. Process Task**.

#### Otherwise

Present it plain. Write its payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/proposed-task.json` with the Write tool — `{"current": …, "total": …, "title": "…", "severity": "…", "sources": "…", "problem": "…", "solution": "…"}` from the staging proposal, adding `"outcome": "…"` when it carries one. `{gate}` is `{gate_mode}` — except a proposal whose fork a Comment on its raise settled this session, which renders `gated` whatever the mode: the settled direction interprets the user's words, so it lands with an explicit approval. Render, and emit each section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render proposed-task {work_unit}.review.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/proposed-task.json --gate {gate} --comment-hint "Tell me what to change"
```

#### If the response carried `DISPLAY: task auto-approved`

Record the approval (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} approved`), then emit the section per its marker.

→ Return to **D. Process Task**.

#### If the response carried `MENU: task approval`

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Record the approval: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} approved`.

→ Return to **D. Process Task**.

**If `auto`:**

Record both in one write: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n}=approved staging.c{N}.gate_mode=auto`.

→ Return to **D. Process Task**.

**If `decline`:**

Record the decline: `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} skipped`.

→ Return to **D. Process Task**.

**If comment:**

Revise the staged proposal in the staging file based on the user's feedback (content only), and rewrite the payload.

→ Return to **D. Process Task**.

---

## E. Route on Results

#### If the manifest's `staging.c{N}.tasks` marks any task `approved`

→ Proceed to **F. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### Otherwise

Nothing is approved — the cycle's proposals were declined, or it staged none.

→ Load **[close-review.md](close-review.md)** with completion_message = `review({work_unit}): synthesis cycle {N} — no tasks approved`, staging_commit = `review({work_unit}): synthesis cycle {N} — staging`.

---

## F. Create Tasks in Plan

The approved proposals carry no bodies — the author expands exactly those, in the staging file, before the writer transcribes them:

→ Load **[invoke-task-author.md](../../workflow-implementation-process/references/invoke-task-author.md)** and follow its instructions as written, with staging file path = `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md`, findings file paths = the cycle's `review-report-c{N}.md`, the per-task `report-*.md` files and the `change-set-c{N}-*.md` files in `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/`, approved task numbers = the task numbers whose `staging.c{N}` rows are `approved`.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the task author has returned.

#### If the author's `STATUS` is `failed`

Nothing was authored. State the author's reason plainly; the staging stays untouched.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If the user resolves the input:**

→ Return to **F. Create Tasks in Plan** — re-invocation is idempotent.

**If the user abandons the tasks:**

Mark each remaining `approved` row `skipped` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging.c{N}.tasks.{n} skipped`).

→ Return to **E. Route on Results**.

#### Otherwise

Filter to the tasks the manifest's `staging.c{N}.tasks` marks `approved`, taking their content from the staging file.

→ Load **[invoke-review-task-writer.md](invoke-review-task-writer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the task writer has returned.

**If the planning item carries no `storage_paths` field** (absent, not empty — a plan initialised before the field existed): record it now — read the format's authoring.md → Storage Pathspecs and copy the fenced array:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} storage_paths '{format storage pathspecs}'
```

Commit the staging file with this topic's implementation artifacts, then the plan tasks and `task_map` updates — `--plan` stages the planning topic, the manifests, and the plan's declared storage:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): stage review remediation" --topic implementation/{topic} --sweep
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): add review remediation — {K} task(s)" --plan {topic}
```

→ On return, proceed to **G. Re-open Implementation**.

---

## G. Re-open Implementation

For each plan that received new tasks:

1. Update the manifest via CLI:
   - `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic reopen {work_unit} implementation {topic}`
   - `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} updated {today's date}`
2. Commit tracking changes:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): re-open implementation tracking" --topic review/{topic}
```

Then enter plan mode and write the following plan. Resolve `{work_type}` from the manifest when not already in context:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit} work_type
```

```
# Review Actions Complete: {work_unit}

Review findings have been synthesized into {N} implementation tasks.

## Summary

{Summary, e.g., "auth-flow: 3 tasks in Phase 9"}

## Next Step

Invoke `/workflow-implementation-entry {work_type} {work_unit} {topic}`

Arguments: work_type = {work_type}, work_unit = {work_unit}, topic = {topic}
The skill will detect the new tasks and start executing them.

## Context

- Plan updated: {work_unit}
- Tasks created: {total count}
- Implementation tracking: re-opened

## How to proceed

Clear context and continue. The fresh session will start
implementation and pick up the new review remediation tasks
automatically.
```

Exit plan mode. The user will approve and clear context, and the fresh session will pick up with the implementation entry skill routing to the new tasks.
