## Per-Task Verification Criteria

For each task, the workflow-review-task-verifier checks:

### Implementation

- Is the task implemented?
- Does the implementation match the acceptance criteria?
- Does it align with spec context (load relevant spec section)?
- Any drift from what was planned?

### Test Adequacy

**Not under-tested:**
- Does a test exist for this task?
- Does the test verify the acceptance criteria?
- Are edge cases from the spec covered?
- Would the test fail if the feature broke?

**Not over-tested:**
- Are tests focused on what matters?
- No redundant assertions testing the same thing?
- No unnecessary mocking or setup?
- Tests aren't testing implementation details instead of behavior?

### Code Quality

Review as a senior architect would:

**Project conventions** (check `.claude/skills/` for project-specific guidance):
- Framework and architecture guidelines defined for the project
- Code style and patterns specific to the codebase

**General principles** (always apply):
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **DRY**: No unnecessary duplication (without premature abstraction)
- **Low complexity**: Reasonable cyclomatic complexity, clear code paths
- **Modern idioms**: Uses current language features appropriately
- **Readability**: Self-documenting code, clear intent
- **Comment accuracy**: Comments in the changed code hold true against it — no claims the code falsifies, no restated code, no references to process artifacts (task ids, phases, spec sections)
- **Security**: No obvious vulnerabilities (injection, exposure, etc.)
- **Performance**: No obvious inefficiencies (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, etc.)

## Quick-Fix Variant

Quick-fix tasks are deliberately authored without acceptance criteria or micro acceptance — never flag their absence. Substitute:

**Implementation** — verify completeness against the task's Verification section:
- Are all target files updated?
- Do any occurrences of the old pattern remain in scope?
- Were exclusions respected?

**Test adequacy** — verify the existing suite still holds instead of new coverage:
- Do all previously passing tests still pass?
- If tests were updated (e.g., to reference a new API), are the updates correct?
- Do not expect new tests — mechanical changes are verified by test baselines.

Code quality criteria apply unchanged.

## Change-Set Verification

After every task is verified, the workflow-review-change-set-verifier holds the whole delivered change-set against the specification's intent — one agent per numbered section plus one over the test surface — measuring where the project's own conventions give a way to and reading where they do not. Each measures the criteria the task verifiers recorded as unsettled and returns a coverage map: what it checked and found sound. The report's Specification Compliance is those maps; a criterion neither layer could settle is named under Plan Completion, never absorbed.

## Plan Completion Check

After task-level and change-set verification, check overall plan completion:

### Phase Acceptance Criteria

For each phase:
- Are all phase-level acceptance criteria that were settled or measured met? An unmeasured criterion counts neither way — it is named under Criteria Not Measured
- Were all tasks in the phase completed? (Tasks the backend marks skipped or cancelled are deliberate discards — they don't count against completion)

### Scope

- Was anything built that wasn't in the plan? (scope creep)
- Was anything in the plan not built? (missing scope)
- Any unplanned files or features added?

### Criteria Not Measured

- Which acceptance criteria did neither reading nor the change-set verification settle? Each is named with its task suffix — disclosed, never ticked

## Common Issues

**Incomplete task**: Task marked done but not fully implemented

**Under-tested**: Missing tests, or tests don't verify acceptance criteria

**Over-tested**: Redundant tests, testing implementation details, excessive mocking

**Requirement drift**: Implementation doesn't match what was planned

**Missing edge cases**: Spec mentions edge cases not implemented or tested

**Scope creep**: Extra features not in plan

**Orphaned code**: Code added but not used or tested

**Poor readability**: Code works but is hard to understand

**Stale comment**: A comment contradicts the code it describes — a finding carrying the replacement text. Classified by its remedy: comment text alone is `[contained]` and never blocks.

## Writing Feedback

Be specific and actionable:

- **Bad**: "Tests need improvement"
- **Good**: "Test `test_cache_expiry` doesn't verify TTL, only that value is returned"

Reference the plan task:

- **Bad**: "This wasn't done correctly"
- **Good**: "Plan Phase 2, Task 3 says 'implement Redis cache' with acceptance 'cache stores values for configured TTL' → implementation uses file cache with no TTL. Task incomplete."

Flag test balance issues:

- **Under-tested**: "Task 2.1 has no test for the error case mentioned in spec section 3.2"
- **Over-tested**: "Task 2.1 has 5 tests that all verify the same happy path with slight variations"

Verify what you cite:

- Re-read the line before quoting its number; never name a symbol you have not located
- Count before claiming a count — "the only site", "the single caller", "eleven call sites" are claims, not colour
- Check that the edit you prescribe is safe applied exactly as written
- Repo-relative paths only

Report only what is wrong:

- **Blocking**: the work cannot be called delivered — acceptance criteria unmet in substance, or behaviour that is broken. Never a finding whose entire remedy is comment or documentation text. Each entry names its remedy, or points at the FINDINGS line that prescribes it, so it can be routed
- **A finding**: something broken or incorrect, or a violation of the spec, the plan, or the project's standards — carrying the concrete failure that follows from leaving it
- **Not reported at all**: a preference none of those require. A fold, an extraction, a rename, a reordering. Ease of doing it is not a reason to raise it
