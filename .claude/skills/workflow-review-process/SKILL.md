# Review Process

Act as a **senior software architect** with deep experience in code review. You haven't seen this code before. Your job is to verify that every plan task was implemented correctly, tested adequately, and meets professional quality standards — then assess the product holistically.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows implementation. Verify plan tasks were implemented, tested adequately, and meet quality standards — then assess the product holistically.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Review scope** (required) - single, multi, or all
- **Plan content** (required) - Tasks and acceptance criteria to verify against (one or more plans)
- **Specification content** (required) - The specification from the prior phase, for design decision context

---

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

---

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely, then re-load [framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md).** Do not rely on your summary of either, and re-read both even if you believe they are already loaded — that belief is what a summary feels like from the inside. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read review and synthesis files** for the current topic. Review documents are at `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/report.md` with per-task report files (`report-{phase_id}-{task_id}.md`) and change-set verification files (`change-set-c{N}-{section-slug}.md`, one per section per review cycle) alongside. Synthesis staging files are at `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/review-tasks-c{N}.md`. These hold the staged proposals — bodies exist only once the task author has run after the walk; the per-task decisions and `gate_mode` live in the manifest's `staging.c{N}` subtree.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Review ALL tasks** — Verify every planned task, or only unreviewed tasks when continuing a prior review
2. **Don't fix code** — Identify problems, don't solve them
3. **Don't re-implement** — You're reviewing, not building
4. **Be specific** — "Test doesn't cover X" not "tests need work"
5. **Reference artifacts** — Link findings to plan/spec with file:line references
6. **Balanced test review** — Flag both under-testing AND over-testing
7. **Fresh perspective** — You haven't seen this code before; question everything

---

## Backlogging

The user says to put an idea aside — "roadmap it", "inbox it", "backlog that", "push it back" — and the words take this door whatever else is in flight. An idea, not a topic: a topic takes the postponing door. Load **[backlogging.md](../workflow-shared/references/backlogging.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `review`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow, re-presenting any gate that was pending — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Postponing the Topic

The user pushes a topic back to the roadmap — "postpone this", "move the loyalty topic to v2", "take this whole topic back to the roadmap" — this one, or one on the map by name; `{name}` is that topic. Load **[postponing-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/postponing-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, name = `{name}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `review`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow, re-presenting any gate that was pending — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Cancelling the Topic

The user calls the topic off — they say to cancel, or the conversation agrees it is not worth pursuing. Never is not yet: a topic wanted later takes the postponing door. Load **[cancelling-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/cancelling-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `review`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow, re-presenting any gate that was pending — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Refresh the tmux session label — a no-op unless the user opted in and this session runs inside tmux:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs session label {work_unit} review {topic}
```

Check for prior review state — a review file at `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/report.md`, and recorded coverage (empty stdout means none):

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.review.{topic} reviewed_tasks
```

#### If neither exists

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Resume Detection`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> An in-progress review exists for this topic — choose whether to pick it up or start fresh.
```

Gather coverage state. Read `completed_tasks` from the implementation manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} completed_tasks
```

Render the resume menu — the engine derives review coverage from the two arrays — and emit its section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render resume-gate {work_unit}.review.{topic} --variant review
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `continue`

**If unreviewed tasks exist:**

Set `unreviewed_tasks` = `[{list of unreviewed internal IDs}]`.

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

**If all tasks reviewed and the review file exists:**

→ Proceed to **Step 10**.

**If all tasks reviewed and no review file exists** (verification finished; everything after it was lost):

Set `unreviewed_tasks` = `[]` — nothing to dispatch; the aggregation re-reads the reports on disk, and the change-set verification dispatches only the sections whose files are missing.

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

**Otherwise** (no tracking data):

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If `restart`

Order matters — the review file is deleted last, so a crash mid-restart re-offers restart on the next entry instead of impersonating a fresh run.

1. Clear review tracking (each subtree only if it exists — check with `manifest exists {work_unit}.review.{topic} reviewed_tasks`, `… staging`, and `… out_of_scope` first):
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.review.{topic} reviewed_tasks
   ```
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.review.{topic} staging
   ```
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.review.{topic} out_of_scope
   ```
2. Delete any synthesis staging files (`review-tasks-c*.md`) in `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/` — stale proposals from the abandoned run. The synthesis reports (`review-report-c*.md`) stay — the cycle counter reads them
3. If the planning item carries no `storage_paths` field (absent, not empty — a plan initialised before the field existed): record it now — read the format's authoring.md (format from `manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format`) → Storage Pathspecs and copy the fenced array (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} storage_paths '{format storage pathspecs}'`)
4. **If the abandoned run's `Review Remediation (Cycle {N})` phase already landed in the plan**: mark each of that phase's tasks whose id is **not** in `{work_unit}.implementation.{topic}` `completed_tasks` skipped per the format's **updating.md** (format from `manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format`) — abandoned remediation must never execute, and a partially-executed phase keeps only what already ran. Then close that phase (`{M}` below is its number) — abandoned work takes no boundary sweep:
   - empty the bank when the manifest holds one (`manifest exists {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} bank`, then `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} bank`)
   - drop an in-flight boundary walk when `staging.p{M}` exists (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} staging.p{M}`), and delete `consolidation-findings-p{M}.md` and `consolidation-tasks-p{M}.md` from `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/`
   - mark the boundary, skipping the push when `consolidated_phases` already contains `{M}` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest push {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} consolidated_phases {M}`)
   - complete the phase in the plan per the format's **updating.md**, then record it via the engine for the phase's last completed task — or, when none ran, any of its skipped tasks with `--skipped` (`node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs task complete {work_unit} {topic} {internal_id} --phase {M} [--skipped] --phase-complete`)
5. Delete the review file, all report files (`report-*.md`) and all change-set files (`change-set-*.md`) in the review directory (`.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/`), and the topic's review cache directory (`.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/`) — the abandoned run's collected criteria and staged payloads
6. Commit the deletions under the topics that held them, then the plan — `--plan` stages the planning topic, the manifests, and the plan's declared storage (the skip-markings live there):
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): restart review — clear reports and staging" --topic review/{topic}
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): restart review — clear staged proposals" --topic implementation/{topic} --sweep
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "review({work_unit}): restart review" --plan {topic}
   ```

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

## Step 1: Initialize Review

Check if review phase is registered in manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest exists {work_unit}.review.{topic}
```

#### If `false`

Start the review item — the engine creates it with `status: in-progress`:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic start {work_unit} review {topic}
```

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.
