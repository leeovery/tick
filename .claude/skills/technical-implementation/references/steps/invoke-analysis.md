# Invoke Analysis Agents

*Reference for **[technical-implementation](../../SKILL.md)***

---

This step dispatches the three analysis agents in parallel to evaluate the completed implementation from different perspectives: duplication, standards conformance, and architecture.

---

## Identify Scope

Build the list of implementation files using git history:

```bash
git log --oneline --name-only --pretty=format: --grep="impl({topic}):" | sort -u | grep -v '^$'
```

This captures all files touched by implementation commits for the topic.

## Dispatch All Three Agents

Dispatch **all three in parallel** via the Task tool. Each agent receives the same inputs:

1. **Implementation files** — the file list from scope identification
2. **Specification path** — from the plan's frontmatter (if available)
3. **Project skill paths** — from `project_skills` in the implementation tracking file
4. **code-quality.md path** — `../code-quality.md`
5. **Topic name** — the implementation topic
6. **Cycle number** — the current analysis cycle number (from `analysis_cycle` in the tracking file)

Each agent knows its own output path convention and writes findings independently.

### Agent 1: Duplication

- **Agent path**: `../../../../agents/implementation-analysis-duplication.md`

### Agent 2: Standards

- **Agent path**: `../../../../agents/implementation-analysis-standards.md`

### Agent 3: Architecture

- **Agent path**: `../../../../agents/implementation-analysis-architecture.md`

---

## Wait for Completion

**STOP.** Do not proceed until all three agents have returned.

Each agent writes its findings to its own output file and returns a brief status. If any agent fails (error, timeout), record the failure and continue — the synthesizer works with whatever findings files are available.
