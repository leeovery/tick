# Final Gap Review

*Reference for **[workflow-discussion-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

A final review ensures the discussion is thorough before moving to specification. Even if review agents ran during the session, the discussion may have progressed significantly since the last one.

This step runs once per entry into the close. It dispatches a fresh review if needed, raises one finding via the surfacing protocol, then bounces back to the discussion session so the user can engage naturally — the ceremony stays open, and once the raise is engaged the session loop's check re-enters the close and Step 6 re-runs. Eventually all findings are drained and the engine incorporates the review, at which point Step 6 returns to the backbone to proceed toward conclusion.

The **never-dump rules apply in full**. Findings are raised one at a time via the surfacing protocol.

**A completed artifact carries no unowned threads.** Every gap this review surfaces resolves before conclusion: settled here, corrected in place, routed to the topic that owns it — existing or newly created, confirmed with the user — parked on the roadmap as a staged product capability, or rejected by you (*not now*, or dismissed for good — the review advises, and the conclusion is yours to call). Closing a finding by writing it into the file as an open thread nobody owns is not a resolution.

## A. Check Review State

Read the store:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} discussion {topic}
```

Councils resolve first — a landed set promotes to synthesis, then synthesis findings drain; tensions that never finished surfacing during the session would otherwise be dropped at conclusion.

#### If a complete `perspective` set has no live `synthesis` row

Every member of the set is `pending` and any prior synthesis is `incorporated` — a landed council awaiting synthesis. Promote it via the **Perspective completion check** in **D. Check and Surface** in **[perspective-agents.md](perspective-agents.md)**, then bounce back to the session — the in-flight gate owns the new synthesis on the next conclusion attempt. An incomplete set (a lens still in flight) is not caught here — the session's in-flight gate already owns that wait-or-proceed decision.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### If any `synthesis` row is `pending` or `acknowledged`

Surface one tension via **D. Check and Surface** in **[perspective-agents.md](perspective-agents.md)**.

**If a tension was raised:**

Bounce back to the session so the user can engage.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

**If the row incorporated without findings** (a clean report):

Nothing awaited engagement — drain any further rows before proceeding.

→ Return to **A. Check Review State**.

**If the row still holds unraised findings** (the user deferred at the announce menu):

The session owns the deferral — the close holds until the findings are walked: the loop's check offers them again at a later break, and the ceremony resumes once they drain.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **B. Review Row State**.

## B. Review Row State

Take the highest-numbered `review` row from the **A** scan and branch on its status.

#### If no review row exists

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Final Review**.

#### If it is `incorporated`

The prior review was fully drained. A fresh one is warranted only when the discussion moved since — otherwise each conclusion attempt mints a new gap set and the topic can never close. The movement check anchors on the last **real** review: the highest-numbered `review` row whose report exists on disk (`.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/{id}.md`, non-empty) — an `incorporated` row with no report is a killed dispatch closed as bookkeeping, never a review.

**If the user declined one more review at this conclusion attempt's closing gate:**

The decline stands — do not re-litigate it. A later conclusion attempt classifies afresh and offers again.

→ Return to caller.

**If no review row has a report** (every review was killed — none ever completed):

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Final Review**.

**If a report exists and no decline was given:**

List what landed after the anchor row's dispatch — `{created}` is the anchor's `created` timestamp, on its scan row; git does the time comparison — then drop commits whose subject carries a `review-` or `synthesis-` drain marker (e.g. `(review-003 F2)`) or a `(deferral)` marker — engagement writes and the conclusion's own deferral write are not new work:

```bash
git log --since='{created}' --format='%h %s' -- .workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md
```

**If no commits remain:**

Nothing new for a fresh review to see — the final-review gate is satisfied. Deterministic — no judgment.

→ Return to caller.

**If a remaining commit is meaningful** (a decision documented, a subtopic explored — not typo fixes, not bookkeeping: document-review reconciliation, summary maintenance). A commit carrying both — a decision documented alongside bookkeeping in one write — is meaningful; the bookkeeping it travels with does not neutralise it:

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Final Review**.

**Otherwise:**

Doubt resolves to satisfied — declining forfeits nothing; a later attempt reclassifies.

→ Return to caller.

#### If it is `in-flight`

The dispatched agent hasn't returned.

**If it was dispatched this session and the user chose `p/proceed` at the session's in-flight gate:**

The wait was already declined for this row — do not watch it. Its results persist for a later session; the final-review gate proceeds without it.

→ Return to caller.

**If it was dispatched this session and the wait was not declined** (the agent may still be running):

Watch for `agent scan` to promote the row to `pending`.

→ Proceed to **D. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

**Otherwise** (an interrupted earlier session — no agent can still be running):

Close the abandoned row, then dispatch fresh:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent incorporate {work_unit} discussion {topic} {id}
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Final Review**.

#### If it is `pending`

A review returned but hasn't been read.

→ Proceed to **D. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

#### If it is `acknowledged`

Findings from the current review are still being drained.

→ Proceed to **D. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

## C. Dispatch Final Review

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
**`□ Dispatch Final Review`**
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Dispatching a final review to catch any gaps before concluding. This ensures the discussion is thorough for specification.
```

Record the dispatch — the engine allocates the id and answers with the content-file path; `--final` marks the mandatory closing pass:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent dispatch {work_unit} discussion {topic} --kind review --final
```

**If the response is `ok: false` naming the triage queue** — a concern landed after the queue gate (a peer session's delivery): surface the engine's error verbatim; the queue owns the close now.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

**Otherwise:**

Read the topic's dismissed grounds — the user's standing rulings on what not to report. Empty output means none:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} dismissed_grounds
```

**Agent path**: `../../../agents/workflow-discussion-review.md`

Dispatch **one agent** as a foreground task (omit `run_in_background` — results are needed before continuing).

The review agent receives:

1. **Discussion file path** — `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`
2. **Output file path** — the `file` from the dispatch response. The agent writes its completed report there — pure markdown with one `### {ID}: {label}` section per finding (`F1`, `F2`, …), never frontmatter.
3. **Dismissed grounds** — the list read above, verbatim. Omit this input entirely when the list is empty.

When the agent returns:

→ Proceed to **D. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

---

## D. Surface via Final Review Menu

→ Load **[final-review-menu.md](final-review-menu.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, phase = `discussion`, topic = `{topic}`.

→ On return, proceed to **E. Route Next**.

---

## E. Route Next

#### If the menu raised a finding (the `review` choice)

Control belongs to the conversation — return the user to the discussion session so they can engage naturally, whether or not that was the last finding. The ceremony stays open: once the raise is engaged, the session loop's check re-enters the close and Step 6 re-runs, raising the next one or finding the row incorporated.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### If the row is still `in-flight` (the watched agent never returned)

Nothing landed to drain — the session's own in-flight gate owns the wait-or-proceed decision.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### Otherwise

No finding is awaiting engagement (the review was clean, fully drained, or skipped). The final-review gate is satisfied.

→ Return to caller.
