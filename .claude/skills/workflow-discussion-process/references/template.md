# Discussion Document Template

*Reference for **[workflow-discussion-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Standard structure for discussion files. DOCUMENT only - no plans or code. Location: `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`.

This is a single file per topic.

**This is a guide, not a form.** Use the structure to capture what naturally emerges from discussion. Don't force sections that didn't come up. The goal is to document the reasoning journey, not fill in every field.

## Template

```markdown
# Discussion: {Topic}

## Context

What this is about, why we're discussing it, the problem or opportunity, current state.

### References

- [Related spec or doc](link)
- [Prior discussion](link)

---

*Subtopics are documented below as they reach `decided` or accumulate enough exploration to capture. Not every subtopic needs its own section — minor items resolved in passing can be folded into their parent. The Discussion Map (which subtopics exist and their states) lives in the manifest, not this file.*

---

## {Subtopic A}

### Context
Why this subtopic matters, what's at stake, how it fits the larger topic.

### Options Considered
The approaches explored. If pros/cons naturally emerged:

**Option A**
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

**Option B**
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

### Journey
The back-and-forth exploration. What we initially thought. What changed our thinking. False paths - "We considered A but realised B because C." The "aha" moments. Small details that mattered.

If there was notable debate:
- **Positions**: What each side argued
- **Resolution**: What made us choose, what detail tipped it

### Decision
What we chose, why, the deciding factor, trade-offs accepted, confidence level.

## {Subtopic B}

*(Same structure: Context → Options → Journey → Decision)*

## Summary

### Key Insights
1. Cross-cutting learning from the discussion
2. Something that applies broadly

### Open Threads
- Anything deliberately deferred or left for future discussion
- Concerns rerouted to other topics (with links)

### Current State
- What's resolved
- What's still uncertain
```

## Usage Notes

**When creating**:
1. Ensure discussion directory exists: `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/`
2. Create file: `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`
3. Start with context: why discussing?
4. Register in the manifest and seed the Discussion Map via the engine `discussion-map add` command (the skill handles this)

**During discussion**:
- Follow the conversation organically — don't force a rigid question order
- Track subtopics on the Discussion Map (manifest state, maintained via the engine `discussion-map` commands)
- Document subtopics when they reach `decided` (or accumulate enough exploration to capture)
- New subtopics emerge naturally — record them on the map as `pending`
- Minor items resolved in passing can be folded into their parent subtopic's documentation

**Per-subtopic structure** (when documenting):
- **Context**: Why this specific subtopic matters
- **Options Considered**: Approaches explored — include pros/cons if they naturally emerged
- **Journey**: The exploration — what we thought, what changed, false paths, debates, insights
- **Decision**: What we chose, why, the deciding factor

**Decision revisions**: A Decision block written in an earlier sitting is never rewritten in place — when a later sitting re-decides it, the block becomes a dated timeline. On the first revision, wrap the block's existing prose verbatim under `#### Initial` (use `#### {YYYY-MM-DD}` instead when the original date is known) and place the new decision above it:

```markdown
#### {YYYY-MM-DD} — revised
*Trigger: {substance — e.g. triage from {origin}: "{concern title}" — {one-line substance} / review finding: {one-line substance} / user reversal: {what changed}}*

{the current decision — what we now choose, why, what changed from the entry below}

#### Initial
{the block's original prose, wrapped verbatim — never edited again}
```

- Entries land only on revision — a block decided once and never revisited stays a plain block
- The latest entry sits directly under the decision heading: the text there is always the current truth. Same-day revisions stack latest-first
- Earlier entries are never edited
- The trigger line carries the substance of what prompted the revision, never a bare cache id — cache files are purged; ids like `review-003 F5` may appear alongside the substance

**Derivation marker**: a decision landed as a settled call — approved from a batch screen rather than argued in conversation — carries a marker line naming what determined it:

```markdown
**Settled by derivation** — not discussed. Determined by {what determined the call — the decision, sibling ground, convention, or principle}@if(from_review_finding) ({id} {finding})@endif.
```

The marker opens the Decision block on a fresh section, and follows the `*Trigger:*` line inside the dated entry on a revision — it marks the derived text, never a block whose `#### Initial` was argued. The section's Journey carries the derivation, not a debate; a later revision wraps the block exactly as above.

**Measured claims**: when a claim about the codebase or toolchain is load-bearing — a decision or insight leans on it — measure it in the moment it's written and record the command with the result, the command alone in its span so it re-runs by copy (`` `rg -l 'pattern' | wc -l` → 14 ``). A claim that can't be measured is written as observation, not fact. Downstream phases re-run these commands; an unmeasured load-bearing claim is the defect they inherit.

**Discussion Map**:
- Subtopic states (`pending`, `exploring`, `converging`, `decided`, `deferred`) live in the manifest — the file holds the knowledge, the map holds the live state
- New child subtopics can be added under top-level parents (two levels max)
- The map is the user's visibility into discussion shape and your tracking mechanism

**Flexibility**: Not every subtopic needs all sections. Some have clear options with pros/cons. Some have heated debate worth capturing. Some are straightforward. Document what naturally came up — don't force structure onto a simple discussion.

**Anti-patterns**:
- Don't pull false paths into a separate top-level section — keep them with the subtopic they relate to
- Don't turn into plan (no implementation steps)
- Don't write code — unless it came up in discussion (e.g., API shape, pattern example) and is relevant to capture
- Don't summarise the journey — document it
- Don't stuff concerns that belong to a different topic into subtopics — reroute them to that topic
- Don't assert tree facts from memory — a load-bearing count, enumeration, or "all X are Y" is measured when written, and carries its command
- Don't record the pipeline — no readiness declarations ("ready for specification"), decided-subtopic counts, or review-cycle tallies, in Current State or anywhere else; the resolved/uncertain rows carry substance, the manifest carries state

**Complete when**:
- All subtopics on the Discussion Map are `decided` (or `deferred`)
- Trade-offs understood
- Path forward clear
