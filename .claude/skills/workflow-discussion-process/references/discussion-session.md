# Discussion Session

*Reference for **[workflow-discussion-process](../SKILL.md)***

## A. Background Agents

Two types of background agent operate during the discussion. Load their lifecycle instructions now — apply them at the appropriate moments during the session loop.

→ Load **[review-agent.md](review-agent.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Load **[perspective-agents.md](perspective-agents.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

---

## B. Session Loop

The discussion is an organic conversation. The Discussion Map is your tracking backbone — it tells you where you are, what's been decided, what's still open, and where to go next. Follow this loop:

1. **Check for findings** — At natural conversational breaks, check for completed agent results and surface them. Skip on the first iteration (no agents have been dispatched yet).
2. **Discuss** — Engage with the user on the current subtopic or wherever the conversation leads. Challenge thinking, push back, explore edge cases. Participate as an expert architect. Follow interesting threads — tangents that surface new concerns are valuable. New subtopics may emerge; add them to the Discussion Map as `pending`.
3. **Navigate** — When a subtopic feels explored or a decision lands, update the Discussion Map and guide the user to what's still open. Don't force transitions — suggest them. The user can follow your suggestion or go wherever they want.
4. **Document** — At natural pauses, update the discussion file. Update the Discussion Map states. When a subtopic reaches `decided`, write up its section (Context → Options → Journey → Decision). Capture provisional thinking for subtopics still in progress if context compaction is a risk.
5. **Commit** — Git commit after each write. Don't batch.
6. **Consider agents** — After each substantive commit, evaluate the trigger conditions defined in the review agent and perspective agent instructions loaded above. If conditions are met, follow their dispatch instructions.
7. **Repeat** — Continue with the next subtopic or follow where the conversation leads.

## C. Subtopic Lifecycle

Subtopics move through states as the conversation progresses:

**pending** → Identified but not yet explored. Sits on the map waiting for attention. New subtopics from tangents, agent findings, or natural discovery start here.

**exploring** → Actively being discussed. Options are surfacing, trade-offs being weighed, edge cases emerging. Only one or two subtopics should be `exploring` at a time — the conversation is linear.

**converging** → Narrowing toward a decision. The options are clear, the trade-offs are understood, and the discussion is honing in on a choice. This signals to both Claude and the user that a decision is close.

**decided** → Decision reached with rationale. The subtopic section gets written up with the full Context → Options → Journey → Decision structure. This is the terminal state.

**State transitions are judgement calls.** Move a subtopic to `converging` when the viable options are narrowed and the discussion is heading toward resolution. Move to `decided` when there's a clear outcome with rationale — even if provisional. Don't wait for absolute certainty.

Child subtopics can exist under parents. A parent might be `exploring` while one of its children is already `decided`. The parent reaches `decided` when all its meaningful children are resolved and the overall concern is addressed.

---

## D. Navigation

Claude owns transitions between subtopics. The goal is natural flow, not rigid sequencing.

**After a decision lands:**

> "That rounds out {subtopic}. We still have {X} and {Y} on the map — {X} is closely related, want to continue there? Or we could pick up {Y}."

**When a tangent surfaces a new concern:**

Add it to the Discussion Map as `pending`. If it's closely related to the current subtopic, it might become a child. If it's independent, it sits at the top level.

> "Good catch — I've added {new subtopic} to the map. Let's finish {current} first and we can pick that up after."

**When the user drives:**

The user can jump to any subtopic at any time. Claude follows and tracks the state change on the map.

**When circling back:**

If a subtopic was partially explored and the conversation moved on, Claude remembers and suggests returning:

> "We touched on {subtopic} earlier but didn't land a decision — worth circling back now that we've resolved {related subtopic}?"

---

## E. Status Display

At natural breaks — after a decision, when transitioning between subtopics, or when the user asks — render the current Discussion Map state. This gives the user visibility into where the discussion stands.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Discussion Map — {topic:(titlecase)}

  {Subtopic A} (decided)
  ├─ {Child} (decided)
  └─ {Child} (decided)

  {Subtopic B} (converging)
  └─ {Child} (exploring)

  {Subtopic C} (pending)

{decided_count} decided · {exploring_count} exploring · {pending_count} pending
```

Don't render the map after every exchange — do it at meaningful transitions. If the user has just seen a similar state, skip it.

## F. Topic Elevation

**This section applies to epic work types only.** For features and bugfixes (single-topic), subtopics stay on the map regardless of scope. Note any out-of-scope concerns in the Summary section for the user to consider separately.

During organic discussion, a subtopic may grow beyond the scope of the current topic — it starts needing its own decisions, its own options exploration, its own trade-offs. When this happens, it's a sibling topic, not a subtopic.

**Heuristic**: If a concern would need its own set of decisions, its own perspective agents, its own full exploration — it's a sibling. If it's a detail that informs a decision within the current topic — it's a subtopic. Example: "How do we handle token refresh?" within an auth discussion = subtopic. "What's our caching strategy?" surfacing during auth because tokens need caching = sibling.

**When you identify a potential sibling:**

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
**{concern}** is expanding beyond a subtopic — it has its own decisions and trade-offs.

- **`e`/`elevate`** — Seed as a separate discussion topic
- **`k`/`keep`** — Keep it as a subtopic here
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `elevate`

1. Create a seed discussion file at `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{new-topic}.md` with:
   - Context section capturing what prompted the topic and any initial thinking from the current discussion
   - A Discussion Map with initial subtopics derived from what's been discussed so far
   - No decisions — those happen in the new discussion
2. Register in manifest:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs init-phase {work_unit}.discussion.{new-topic}
   ```
3. Update the current Discussion Map: replace the subtopic with `→ Elevated: {new-topic}`
4. Commit: `discussion({work_unit}/{topic}): elevate {new-topic} to separate discussion`

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If `keep`

Leave it as a subtopic on the map.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

## G. Convergence

Convergence is the natural end state — not a forced conclusion. The discussion converges when:

- All subtopics on the Discussion Map are `decided` (or deliberately deferred)
- Neither Claude nor the user can identify new subtopics without breaking scope
- The review agent has had a chance to flag gaps (at least one review cycle completed)

**When convergence is reached:**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
All subtopics on the Discussion Map are decided.
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Discussion complete. Ready to conclude?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Conclude discussion
- **Keep going** — Continue discussing to explore further
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

→ Return to caller.

#### If keep going

Continue the discussion. The user may want to revisit a decision, explore an edge case further, or probe for gaps. If new subtopics emerge, add them to the map and continue.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

---

## H. When the User Signals Conclusion

When the user indicates they want to conclude the discussion (e.g., "that covers it", "let's wrap up", "I think we're done") before natural convergence:

#### If there are subtopics still `pending` or `exploring`

Render the Discussion Map and note which subtopics are unresolved.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
There are still {N} subtopics not yet decided:

{list of pending/exploring subtopics}

- **`y`/`yes`** — Conclude anyway (unresolved items noted in Summary)
- **`n`/`no`** — Continue discussing
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Note unresolved subtopics in the Summary → Open Threads section of the discussion file. Commit.

→ Return to caller.

**If `no`:**

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If all subtopics are `decided`

Check for in-flight agents. If agents are still running:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
There are still {N} background agents working.

- **`w`/`wait`** — Wait for results before concluding
- **`p`/`proceed`** — Conclude now (results will persist in cache for reference)
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `wait`:**

Check for agent completion. When all agents have returned, check for findings and surface them.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Return to caller.

**If no agents are in flight:**

→ Return to caller.
