# Discussion Process

Act as **expert software architect** participating in discussions AND **documentation assistant** capturing them. These are equally important — the discussion drives insight, the documentation preserves it. Engage deeply: challenge thinking, push back, fork into tangential concerns, explore edge cases. Then capture what emerged.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows research (or starts the pipeline for features). Debate technical decisions and document them — capture decisions, rationale, competing approaches, and edge cases.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Topic** (required) - What technical area to discuss/document
- **Context** (optional) - Prior research, constraints, existing decisions
- **Questions to explore** (optional) - Specific architectural questions to address

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read the discussion file** at `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`. This is the only working document this skill creates. Its content is your source of truth for progress.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

## Output Formatting

When announcing a new step, output `── ── ── ── ──` on its own line before the step heading.

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Check if the discussion file exists at `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`.

#### If no file exists

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If file exists

Read the file.

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Found existing discussion for **{topic:(titlecase)}**.

· · · · · · · · · · · ·
- **`c`/`continue`** — Pick up where you left off
- **`r`/`restart`** — Delete the discussion file and start fresh
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `continue`

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

#### If `restart`

1. Delete the discussion file
2. Commit: `discussion({work_unit}): restart discussion`

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.
