SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All 10 specified checks (9 errors, 1 warning) are implemented with correct severity levels. Exit codes match spec (0 for no errors/warnings-only, 1 for errors). Output format uses the specified markers, suggestion text matches spec wording (cache stale suggests `tick rebuild`, all others suggest "Manual fix required"), and doctor correctly bypasses the format/formatter machinery for human-readable-only output. The diagnostic-only invariant (never modifies data) is enforced via read-only DB access and verified by dedicated tests. The runner executes all checks without short-circuiting per spec principle #4. Go conventions are followed: exported types/functions documented, errors wrapped with %w, context keys use unexported struct types, table-driven tests with subtests used throughout.
