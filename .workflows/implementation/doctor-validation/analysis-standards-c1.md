AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All 9 error checks and 1 warning check match the spec's validation matrix. Exit codes correctly return 0 for warnings-only and 1 for errors. Output format follows the spec's human-readable-only constraint with correct markers, suggestions, and summary line. The doctor command correctly bypasses the format/formatter machinery. All checks are read-only as required. Fix suggestions match the spec's table (cache stale suggests `tick rebuild`, all other errors suggest "Manual fix required"). The ChildBlockedByParentCheck appends a deadlock explanation to its suggestion text which is slightly more verbose than the bare "Manual fix required" pattern, but this is reasonable given the spec says suggestions should include "explanation of what's wrong" and does not warrant a finding.
