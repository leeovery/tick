AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture is sound. All three prior cycle findings (missing type column in queryShowData, ResolveID double-lock, list --parent partial ID resolution) are verified correctly fixed. Domain/storage/CLI boundaries are well-separated, the Formatter interface composes cleanly across three implementations with appropriate use of baseFormatter embedding, partial ID resolution is now consistent across all ID-accepting parameters, and the new junction tables (task_tags, task_refs, task_notes) follow the established dependencies pattern with proper schema, indexing, and cache rebuild integration.
