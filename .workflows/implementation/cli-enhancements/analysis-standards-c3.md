AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All six spec features (partial ID matching, task types, tags, external references, notes, list count/limit) are implemented as specified. Previous cycle findings (missing type column in queryShowData, list --parent partial ID resolution) are verified fixed. Validation rules, storage schema, CLI flag semantics, mutual exclusivity constraints, display formats, and filter behavior all match the specification.
