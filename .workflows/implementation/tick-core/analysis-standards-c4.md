AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All findings from cycles 1-3 have been resolved: dependency validation on create/update write paths (C1), Unicode arrow in transitions (C1), child-blocked-by-parent error message with explanatory second line (C1), create output with full relationship context (C2), and duplicate prevention in applyBlocks (C3). The tick doctor command remains absent but is explicitly deferred to a separate specification per the plan (Phase 5 note). No new spec drift or convention violations detected in cycle 4.
