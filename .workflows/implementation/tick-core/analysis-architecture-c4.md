AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture remains sound after cycle 4 additions. The three concrete formatters (Toon, Pretty, JSON) implement the Formatter interface consistently with compile-time verification and shared baseFormatter for text-based transition/dep output. Parent scoping composes cleanly with existing list filters via buildListQuery and recursive CTE in queryDescendantIDs. The workflow integration test and format integration test validate cross-command seam quality end-to-end. The three-layer structure (task model, storage orchestration, CLI commands) maintains clean boundaries with consistent Run* function signatures. The only vestigial artifacts are the StubFormatter (documented as replaced by concrete implementations, no callers) and two empty files (ready.go, blocked.go) -- neither impacts architecture quality.
