AGENT: duplication
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No new duplication detected in cycle 3. Cycle 1 findings (manual presenter calls, inconsistent fallback strings) were resolved. Cycle 2 confirmed the codebase was clean. Remaining minor patterns (empty-title guards in presenter, copy-and-sort in availableProviders/UnknownProviderError) remain below extraction threshold per Rule of Three and are not cross-file duplication requiring consolidation.
