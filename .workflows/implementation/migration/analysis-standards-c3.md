AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All findings from cycles 1 and 2 have been addressed: RunMigrate uses Present for complete output, beads provider surfaces invalid entries for engine reporting, FallbackTitle constant is used consistently, task.Status type replaces raw strings, and beadsIssue.Priority is *int to distinguish absent from zero. No new spec drift found in cycle 3.
