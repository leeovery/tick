AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All spec decisions remain faithfully implemented with no new drift: install script macOS/Linux branching, architecture mapping, asset naming across goreleaser/install.sh/Homebrew, fallback directory logic, overwrite-by-default, no fallback chains, and no self-update. Go skill compliance (exported docs, explicit error handling, table-driven tests) and code-quality standards are satisfied.
