SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All spec decisions are faithfully implemented: four installation methods (install script, Homebrew, GitHub releases, go install), correct asset naming convention across goreleaser/install.sh/Homebrew formula, platform detection with specified architecture mapping, macOS Homebrew delegation with correct error message on missing brew, Linux binary download with /usr/local/bin primary and ~/.local/bin fallback, overwrite-by-default behavior, no fallback chains, and no self-update mechanism. Go skill MUST DO rules are satisfied (exported functions documented, errors handled explicitly, table-driven tests used). No new drift found beyond what was addressed in prior cycles.
