SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All spec decision points verified for cycle 2: command interface (remove, --force/-f, positional IDs), all-or-nothing validation before any mutation, silent deduplication with first-occurrence order, interactive confirmation with blast radius on stderr (cascade descendants and dependency-affected tasks listed), case-insensitive y/yes acceptance, Aborted to stderr with exit code 1 on decline (no Error prefix), --force bypass, recursive cascade deletion via collectDescendants, atomic dependency cleanup inside Store.Mutate, FormatRemoval on all three formatters (baseFormatter shared by toon/pretty, JSON with [] not null for empty arrays), --quiet suppression, help text documenting cascade behavior and Git recovery. Golang-pro MUST DO rules satisfied: exported types/functions documented, errors handled explicitly, subtests used throughout. No MUST NOT DO violations found.
