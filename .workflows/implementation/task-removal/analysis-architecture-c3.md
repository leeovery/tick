AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture is sound. The c1 and c2 findings have been properly addressed: RunRemove now follows the standard handler signature with pre-parsed IDs (consistent with RunList taking a pre-parsed ListFilter), computeBlastRadius and applyRemoval are cleanly split with shared internals via validateAndExpand and collectDescendants, ReadTasks uses a shared lock for the non-force confirmation path avoiding spurious JSONL rewrites, and the errAborted sentinel integrates cleanly with App.Run's error handling. The inherent TOCTOU gap between ReadTasks-based confirmation and Mutate-based execution is acceptable for a single-user CLI tool.
