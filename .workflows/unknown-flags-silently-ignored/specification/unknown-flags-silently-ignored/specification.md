# Specification: Unknown Flags Silently Ignored

## Specification

## Problem

Unknown flags passed to any `tick` command are silently ignored. Arguments starting with `-` that aren't recognised are stripped without warning, which can mislead users into thinking a flag had effect.

**Example:** `tick dep add tick-aaa --blocks tick-bbb` silently ignores `--blocks` (only valid on `create`/`update`) and treats it as `tick dep add tick-aaa tick-bbb`.

## Requirements

1. All commands must reject unrecognised flags with a clear error message
2. Known global flags (`--quiet`, `--verbose`, `--toon`, `--pretty`, `--json`, `--help`) must not be rejected by command-level validation
3. The fix must cover all commands: `create`, `update`, `list`, `show`, `dep add/remove`, `remove`, `note add/remove`, `start`, `done`, `cancel`, `reopen`, `stats`, `doctor`, `init`, `rebuild`, `migrate`, `ready`, `blocked`

## Design

### Approach: Command-Exported Flags + Central Validation

Each command exports its set of valid flags. The dispatcher validates args against that set before invoking the handler. Flag knowledge stays with the command, validation logic is written once centrally.

### Flow

1. `parseArgs()` strips global flags, identifies subcommand, collects `rest`
2. Look up valid flags for the identified command, validate `rest` against them — error on any unknown flag
3. Dispatch to command handler (which can now assume all flags are valid)

### Rationale

- **Inline validation** (rejected): replacing the silent skip with `fmt.Errorf` in every command duplicates validation logic and requires every new command to remember to add it
- **Central flag registry** (rejected): a `map[string][]string` in `app.go` creates a second place to maintain flag knowledge alongside the parsers
- **Command-exported flags + central validation** (chosen): flag knowledge lives with the command, validation written once. No duplication of either flag definitions or validation logic

### Flag Metadata

Each command exports its flags with type information — whether each flag is boolean (standalone) or value-taking (consumes next argument). The validator uses this to correctly skip value positions when iterating args. For example, given `--priority 3 --unknown`, the validator must know `--priority` takes a value so `3` is skipped and `--unknown` is checked.

### Dispatch Paths

`migrate` and `doctor` are dispatched before format resolution (a separate code path from the main dispatch switch). Validation must cover both dispatch paths to ensure all commands are protected.

### Pre-Subcommand Validation

`parseArgs()` gains an error return value. When it encounters an unknown flag before the subcommand is identified, it returns an error immediately. This is the simplest change — the existing call site in `App.Run()` already handles errors from other sources in the same flow.

### Two-Level Commands

For compound commands (`dep add/rm`, `note add/remove`), the dispatcher already identifies the top-level command (`dep`, `note`) and extracts the sub-subcommand. Flag validation happens after this extraction — the validator looks up flags for the fully-qualified command (e.g., `dep add`). The error message uses the fully-qualified command name. Flags appearing anywhere in the args for these commands are validated against the same set.

### Excluded Commands

`version` and `help` are excluded from flag validation. Both are informational commands that exit immediately. `help` accepts an optional command name and `--all` flag but these are handled inline and do not need central validation.

### Normalize Migrate Flag Parsing

Remove `--from=value` (equals-sign) syntax support from `parseMigrateArgs`. Only `--from value` (space-separated) will be supported, consistent with all other commands. This eliminates a special case the central validator would otherwise need to handle.

### Cleanup

The existing `strings.HasPrefix(arg, "-")` silent-skip logic in each command's parser can be removed — unknown flags are caught before the handler is called.

## Command Flag Inventory

### Global Flags

Accepted by all commands, stripped before dispatch:

| Flag | Short |
|------|-------|
| `--quiet` | `-q` |
| `--verbose` | `-v` |
| `--toon` | — |
| `--pretty` | — |
| `--json` | — |
| `--help` | `-h` |

### Per-Command Flags

| Command | Accepted Flags |
|---------|---------------|
| `init` | *(none)* |
| `create` | `--priority`, `--description`, `--blocked-by`, `--blocks`, `--parent`, `--type`, `--tags`, `--refs` |
| `update` | `--title`, `--description`, `--priority`, `--parent`, `--clear-description`, `--type`, `--clear-type`, `--tags`, `--clear-tags`, `--refs`, `--clear-refs`, `--blocks` |
| `list` | `--ready`, `--blocked`, `--status`, `--priority`, `--parent`, `--type`, `--tag`, `--count` |
| `show` | *(none)* |
| `start` | *(none)* |
| `done` | *(none)* |
| `cancel` | *(none)* |
| `reopen` | *(none)* |
| `ready` | same as `list` minus `--ready` |
| `blocked` | same as `list` minus `--blocked` |
| `dep add` | *(none)* |
| `dep rm` | *(none)* |
| `note add` | *(none)* |
| `note remove` | *(none)* |
| `remove` | `--force` / `-f` |
| `stats` | *(none)* |
| `doctor` | *(none)* |
| `rebuild` | *(none)* |
| `migrate` | `--from`, `--dry-run`, `--pending-only` |

## Error Behavior

When an unknown flag is encountered, the command must fail immediately with a clear error message.

**Error message format:**

```
Error: unknown flag "{flag}" for "{command}". Run 'tick help {command}' for usage.
```

**Examples:**
- `tick dep add tick-aaa --blocks tick-bbb` → `Error: unknown flag "--blocks" for "dep add". Run 'tick help dep' for usage.`
- `tick show --verbose tick-abc123` → *(no error — `--verbose` is a known global flag)*
- `tick list --unknown` → `Error: unknown flag "--unknown" for "list". Run 'tick help list' for usage.`

**Exit code:** Non-zero (consistent with existing error handling)

**Unknown flags before subcommand:** `parseArgs()` currently silently skips unknown flags appearing before the subcommand is identified. These must also be rejected with: `Error: unknown flag "{flag}". Run 'tick help' for usage.`

## Testing

1. Each command rejects an unknown flag with the correct error message
2. Global flags (`--verbose`, `--json`, etc.) are not rejected by command-level validation
3. The specific `dep add --blocks` scenario from the bug report is covered
4. Short flags (`-x`) are rejected as well as long flags (`--unknown`)
5. Unknown flags before the subcommand are rejected

## Dependencies

No dependencies. This bugfix modifies existing CLI flag parsing logic entirely within `internal/cli/`. No external systems, data, or infrastructure are required.
