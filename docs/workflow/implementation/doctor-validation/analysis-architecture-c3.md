AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture is sound -- clean boundaries, appropriate abstractions, good seam quality. Cycles 1 and 2 resolved the material issues (redundant file parsing, context-bag type safety, compose-don't-duplicate for ParseTaskRelationships, derived issue counts). The remaining patterns (knownIDs map built independently in 3 checks, context-based data caching) are locally contained, proportionate to current usage, and do not create latent bugs or fragile assumptions. The Check interface is clean and consistent, the runner/report/format layering is well-scoped, and the CLI integration correctly pre-scans once and distributes via context.
