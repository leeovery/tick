SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions after Phase 4 refactoring. All 10 checks (9 errors + 1 warning) match the spec's validation matrix. The shared data extraction layer (jsonl_reader.go context-based caching via getJSONLines, task_relationships.go context-based caching via getTaskRelationships) does not change spec behavior -- checks still run independently and report individually. Exit codes remain correct: 0 when only warnings exist, 1 when any error exists. Output format uses spec-mandated markers, suggestions, and summary count. Fix suggestions conform to spec table (cache stale suggests `tick rebuild`, all others suggest "Manual fix required"). The ID format regex correctly enforces lowercase hex per tick-core spec. Case-insensitive duplicate detection correctly uses strings.ToLower per spec requirement. Doctor remains diagnostic-only and never modifies data, verified by integration tests. All exported types and functions have doc comments per golang-pro MUST DO rules. Error propagation uses fmt.Errorf with %w wrapping where applicable.
