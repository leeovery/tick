AGENT: duplication
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No significant duplication detected across implementation files. Cycle 1 findings (manual presenter calls, inconsistent fallback strings) have been resolved. Remaining minor patterns (3-line empty-title guards in WriteResult and WriteFailures, copy-and-sort in availableProviders and UnknownProviderError) are below extraction threshold per the Rule of Three.
