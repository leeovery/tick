SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All four installation methods (install script, Homebrew, GitHub releases via goreleaser, go install) align with the spec. Asset naming is consistent across goreleaser, install.sh, and the Homebrew formula. The install script correctly implements the specified platform detection, architecture mapping, macOS Homebrew delegation, Linux binary download flow, install directory selection with fallback, and overwrite-by-default behavior. The release workflow triggers on semver tags and excludes pre-releases as expected. Cycle 1 findings (README documentation gap, ignored error comment) were already addressed or discarded; no new drift detected.
