# Analysis Report: Installation (Cycle 3)

## Summary
Cycle 3 found minimal issues. Standards and architecture agents report clean -- all prior cycle fixes hold and the implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. The only finding is a medium-severity duplication in test code: an 8-line TMPDIR extraction block repeated verbatim in two adjacent tests.

## Discarded Findings
(none)
