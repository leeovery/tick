FINDINGS:
- FINDING: No cross-validation between goreleaser asset naming and install script/formula URL construction
  SEVERITY: medium
  FILES: .goreleaser.yaml:24, scripts/install.sh:56, homebrew-tap/Formula/tick.rb:9
  DESCRIPTION: The goreleaser name_template ("tick_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}") and the install script's construct_url function ("${BINARY_NAME}_${version_no_v}_${os}_${arch}.tar.gz") must produce identical filenames. The Homebrew formula URL ("tick_#{version}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz") has the same implicit contract. These three sources of truth are independently maintained with no test asserting they agree. If any side drifts (e.g., goreleaser template changes to include a "v" prefix, or adds an OS name mapping), installs silently break with 404 errors. This is a classic cross-component seam that is easy to miss because each file has its own passing tests in isolation.
  RECOMMENDATION: Add a single integration test (in a shared test file or in scripts/) that parses the goreleaser name_template and verifies the install script's construct_url output and the Homebrew formula URL pattern produce the same filename for a given version/os/arch tuple. Alternatively, extract the naming convention into a single constant or template that all three consumers reference, though for a mixed Go/bash/Ruby system the test approach is more practical.
SUMMARY: The implementation is well-structured with clean testability seams in the bash script and thorough test coverage per component. The main architectural gap is the absence of cross-component validation between the three independent sources of asset naming convention (goreleaser, install script, Homebrew formula), which creates a latent drift risk at the most critical seam in the system.
