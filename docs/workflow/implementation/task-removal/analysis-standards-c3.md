SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All spec decision points verified for cycle 3: command name "remove" with no alias, --force/-f flag, positional task IDs with silent deduplication (case-insensitive normalization, first-occurrence order), exact no-args error message matching spec, all-or-nothing validation (first invalid ID reported, no partial removal), interactive confirmation with blast radius on stderr (target tasks, cascaded descendants, affected dependencies), [y/N] convention with capital N default, case-insensitive y/yes acceptance, Aborted to stderr with exit code 1 on decline (no Error prefix), --force bypasses prompt entirely, recursive cascade deletion via parent-to-children index walk, atomic dependency cleanup inside Store.Mutate stripping all removed IDs from surviving tasks' BlockedBy arrays, FormatRemoval method on Formatter interface implemented by all three formatters (baseFormatter shared by toon/pretty producing "Removed {id} {title}" lines plus optional "Updated dependencies on" line; JSONFormatter producing structured object with removed[] and deps_updated[] arrays that are always [] not null), --quiet suppression, ReadTasks with shared lock for pre-mutation blast radius computation, help text documenting cascade behavior and Git recovery. Golang-pro MUST DO rules satisfied: exported types/functions documented, errors wrapped with fmt.Errorf %w, table-driven subtests used throughout. No MUST NOT DO violations found.
