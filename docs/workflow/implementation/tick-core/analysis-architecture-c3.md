AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture is sound. All cycle 1-2 findings have been resolved: RunRebuild uses Store.Rebuild(), ready-query SQL is extracted into shared query_helpers.go, store-opening boilerplate is consolidated in openStore(), dead VerboseLog and duplicate relatedTask types are removed, and an end-to-end workflow integration test validates cross-command seam quality. The three-layer structure (task model, storage orchestration, CLI commands) has clean boundaries with consistent Run* function signatures. The raw *sql.DB exposure in Store.Query was accepted as a v2 concern in cycle 1 and remains appropriate for the current schema scale. The only minor observation is that log.Printf calls in store.go (lines 133, 253, 266) bypass the injected io.Writer pattern for warning output, but these are rare error-recovery paths and do not merit a finding at this cycle.
