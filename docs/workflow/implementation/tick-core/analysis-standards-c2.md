AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All cycle 1 high-severity findings (missing dependency validation in create --blocked-by and --blocks) have been fixed with proper ValidateDependency/ValidateDependencies calls. The doctor command has been removed from help text. No new spec drift detected in cycle 2 review.
