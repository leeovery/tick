# Discussion: Migration Subcommand

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Status**: Exploring

## Context

Tick needs a way to import task data from other tools. Users migrating to tick shouldn't have to manually recreate their existing tasks. The initial focus is on beads (a task format used in claude-technical-workflows), with potential to expand to other tools later.

This discussion focuses on the high-level use case and design - implementation details will be addressed in later phases.

### References

- Prior art: beads format (claude-technical-workflows)

## Questions

- [ ] What's the core use case for migration?
- [ ] What should the command look like?
- [ ] Which source tools should we support (and in what order)?
- [ ] How should we handle data that doesn't map cleanly?
- [ ] Should migration be one-time or ongoing sync?
